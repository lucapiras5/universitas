# 2021-09-28 -- Law of the European Union

## 3:41 Enlargement process

- The enlargement of the EU (the possibility of new States to join the EU) is not a new feature
- Many international institutions allow new States to join them, if they meet certain criteria and follow a certain procedure
- Becoming a MS of the EU means that the State will enjoy rights, and fulfil obligations

## 5:47 History of the enlargement process

- The enlargement process was parallel to the strengthening of the EU, and its increasing integration
- There was a first round of newcomers in 1973, when the UK, Ireland and Denmark joined
- In 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden joined, but Norway decided not to join, after a referendum
- In 2004, a large number of countries, including some Eastern European ones, joined the EU
- In 2009, Romania and Bulgaria joined as well (they were meant to join in 2004, but there were issues in the negotiation process)
- In 2021, UK's decision to leave the EU came into effect

## 8:49 Existence of a right of accession

- Is there a "right" of accession to the EU?
- The EU CoJ has declared that there is a sovereign right to leave the Union, meaning it can't be subject to any kind of limitations
- If there is a right to leave, does it mean there's also a right to join?
- Since there's criteria and rules to join, one could say there is a right "to submit an application", which may or may not accepted
- Compared to other international organizations, the EU has pretty strict requirements
- There is also a political dimension, that is, the position taken by other MS, and the EU

## 12:55 Criteria for joining the UN 

- Before analyzing the requirements for accession in the EU, it's useful to consider the requirements for accession in other organizations
- According to the Charter of the UN, membership is open to all other "peace-loving States" who accept the obligations in the Charter, and in the judgement of the UN are able and willing to carry out these obligations
- There are three requirements in that article
- The first is being a peace-loving State, which means promoting peace and international security
- The second is accepting the obligations in the charter, which means also being able and willing to carry them out
- The third is an implicit requirement, that the entities who ask for membership are "States"
- In the international community, there are entities other than States
- Furthermore, there are some entities that describe themselves as states, but there are doubts about their Statehood
- E.g., Kosovo and Palestine status as States is controversial
- There are some international organzations that allow other intl. orgs. to acceed (e.g. the EU is a member of the WTO)

## 17:38 Definition of a State

- What is a State? There are three elements to Statehood
- Having a territory (with a defined border)
- Having a population (who lives within the border)
- Having a government (an independent and sovereign authority who controls the population)
- In the presence of these three elements, there is a State
- Recognition by other States is useful, but not necessary, international law doesn't require recognition for States to exist

## 19:37 Procedure for joining the UN

- Besides the substantive criteria in the UN Charter, there is also the procedure that must be followed
- The Security Council makes a recommendation, which is then approved by the General Assembly, with a 2/3 majority

## 20:13 Procedure for joining the Council of Europe

- The Council of Europe is a regional organization, that is distinct from the EU
- According to art. 4 of the CoE Statute, any State able and willing to fulfil the provisions in art. 3 may be invited to become a member, by the Council of Ministers
- Again, the invitation is from the main political body of the institution, but there are also substanstive requirements
- The State must be "European", and it must be able and willing to fulfil the obligations defined by the organization
- The first requirement is a geographical one; in the case of the EU, there is also the issue of shared historical and cultural elements

## 23:09 Summary: joining an international organization

- There are political or substantial criteria, and a procedure
- Political institutions (the General Assembly and the Security Council for the UN, the Committe of Ministers for the CoE) determine who can be a member of the organization

## 24:23 Conditions for joining the EU

- Art. 49 TEU makes a reference to the criteria to become a MS of the EU
- Only States can join the Union
- States are identified by the same criteria as intl. law (territory, population, government)
- Recognition is not necessary for Statehood, but it's a supporting factor

## 28:08 Recognition of Balkan States after the Balkan War

- There is a recognition practice by the EU States, starting from the 90's, regarding the former Yugoslavian States
- After the Balkan War, the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia dissolved into new States
- The majority of EU States decided to recognize them as States
- There were some doubts at the international level, as to whether they actually fulfilled the criteria
- The EU States decided to exercise a political influence as well on the new Balkan States, since they were considering whether they could join the EU

## 31:18 "European" State

- Art. 49 TEU mentions that only "European States" can become Members of the Union
- As a first approximation, it should be State that's located in Europe (as a continent)
- Turkey is a candidate MS, which means that the EU institutions, in order to enter negotiations with it, must consider Turkey an "European State"
- However, from a geographical point of view, only a small part of Turkey is located in Europe, the rest is in Central Asia
- Besides the geographical position, EU institutions consider also the history and culture in relation with Europe
- From that point of view, Turkey is fully intertwined with the history of the European continent
- "European State" is a vague notion, and the political actors of the EU have a discretionary power to decide whether a given country is a European country or not
- It's not a strict requirement, and it has been introduced in the Treaty to allow countries to determine whether a country should be able to join the Union
- E.g., if Switzerland were to decide to submit an application, it would be hard to deny it
- E.g., it's not clear whether Russia could be considered an European country
- The decision about whether a country is European or not is an inherently political decision

## 37:17 Question: San Marino

- San Marino is a State, and if it were to decide to submit an application, it would be impossible not to recognize it as an European State
- The discretionary power to exclude it may be used with other criteria

## 37:52 "Peace-loving State" in the UN Charter

- These are legal criteria that imply a political assesment, and allow MS to exercise a discretionary power
- The same kind of criteria is found in the UN Charter, with the expression "peace-loving State"

## 38:57 Fundamental values of the EU

- A prospective European State must also respect the fundamental values of the EU, which are listed in art. 2 TEU
- They are the respect of human rights, of minorities' rights, freedom, democracy, equality, respect of human dignity and rule of law

## 40:03 "Acquis" criterion

- Other criteria, not mentioned in art. 49 TEU, have been developed in practice over time
- Art. 49 TEU states that the European Council (the institution made up of the heads of government of the MS) can define additional criteria that States must meet to become MS
- In 1993, in Copenhagen, the EC adopted new political criteria
- The first criterion is that States have to fulfil the obligations flowing from the treaties of the EU
- In other words, they have to respect the "acquis" of the EU, the set of rules which have been developed at the EU level, including the case law of the Euroean Court of Justice
- States who want to join the EU must be willing to adopt into their legal system this set of rules

## 42:58 Market economy criterion

- The second political criterion has to do with the economic dimension, since the EU is also founded on economic cooperation and integration
- A State willing to acceed in the EU must be willing to accept a market economy, and the related principles, starting from the respect of fair competition among the economic operators

## 43:46 Purpose of the criteria: economic stability

- These two criteria introduced in Copenhagen are illustrative of the role that selection criteria can play in the enlargement process
- They represent a sort of filter, the EU institutions are a gatekeeper against States that want to join the Union
- At the same time, they represent a sort of guarantee for the member States of the EU
- Becoming a member of the EU is not easy, there is a large amount of obligations that States have to respect, and their internal market must be able to handle the pressure of the internal market
- If a State is unable to keep up with the demands, it would cause problems for the other Member States too
- E.g., there was an attempt to develop a Constitution for the entirety of Europe, but two States refused to ratify the treaty (The Netherlands and France)
- In the case of France, they refused to sign the treaty, because they were worried about a flood of Eastern European migrants into the local market
- That's an issue caused by a State being unable to handle the pressure of the internal market, and the free movement of workers
- The respect of those criteria is to protect the MS as well; if there are doubts about the fitness of a State to join the EU, the process can be blocked to safeguard the interal market and the integration process

## 48:26 Purpose of the criteria: political issues 

- There are also political evaluations to be made
- E.g., if the evaluation at the time should've been stricter, to avoid the rule of law issues in some Eastern European countries
- The issue was due to a political decision, that those Eastern European countries should be under the influence of Europe, rather than Russia
- That is why they were incorporated, despite the fact that there were some doubts

## 49:36 Question: ...

- ...

## 50:14 Summary: crit

## 50:45 Procedure

- The subjects involved in the accession procedure at the EU level are the Council (an institution that represents MS at the ministerial level), the Parliament (it represents the people), the Commission (it represents the EU, it's composed of individuals acting on behalf of the general interests of the Union and MS)
- The treaties acknowledge that States may initiate the accession procedure unilaterally
- The EU institutions, and in particular, the Commission, are prevented from acting in order to enter into relations with that country, or convince the country to start the enlargement process

## 53:08 Preliminary phases

- Generally speaking, the decision to submit an application is the result of a long journey
- Before submitting an application, States conclude stabilization agreements, aiming to include parts of the EU acquis into their legal order
- Since it's a long process, States prefer to join the EU in stages
- In some recent cases, especially in the case of Eastern European countries, these agreements were called "European agreements", to remark that they were being adopted for the purposes of enlargement

## 56:23 Council vote, unanimity mechanism

- Once a State decides to submit an application to acceed, a decision from the Council is needed
- The Council (the institution made by States) votes according to the unanimity mechanism, by which every single state may pose a veto
- It is one of the most important decisions in the life of the EU, so it makes sense to maintain such strict control over it
- It's also the reason why it's so difficult for some entities to become MS
- E.g. Catalunya declared independence from Spain, and Spain reacted strongly, while the EU mostly remained silent
- There were some declarations by the President of the Commission
- To Spain, they stated that they respected the territorial integrity of Spain, but recommended not to use force
- To the Catalunyan authorities, that if they considered themselves an independent State, they couldn't automatically consider themselves a MS, but they had to start negotiations
- That meant that Catalunya would never become a MS, because Spain could just issue a veto


## 1:00:10 Scotland

- The same logic applies to Scotland
- The existing tensions have been exacerbated with Brexit, and there is the perspective of a new referendum on independence
- It's possible that in the near future, Scotland will declare its independence from the UK
- However, if Scotland becomes a new State, it will have to start the integration procedure
- Even though it is no longer possible for the UK to oppose a veto, since they're no longer a member, other countries could

## 1:01:49: EU Commission, chapters

- The veto power is useful in determining who can join the EU, but at the same time, it can be harmful in the context of international relationships
- If the Council agrees to the application, negotiations may begin
- The EU Commission in particular will analyze the respect of the country of the EU's acquis, which is split in 30 chapters
- E.g., a chapter is dedicated to agriculture, one to justice, one to consumer protection, etc...
- It is a time-consuming and expensive process, and it is usually financially supported by the EU
- States have to undergo reforms, that could have significant economic effects
- There are some key chapters, but in general, the EU tries to support all chapters of negotiation

## 1:05:50 Second stage: individual MS

- The Parliament is involved too, and has to give an opinion
- After the final stage of negotiations has been reached, and the State is ready to become a MS, there is an inter-governmental procedure
- After the EU institutions, the MS will negotiate an accession treaty with the new MS
- The institutions take a political decision, whether the State should be considered a candidate, and to assess its compliance with the EU acquis
- Then there is an intergovernmental procedure, governed by MS, each MS will negotiate an agreement containing the conditions for acceeding
- This agreement must be concluded with all countries, which means that each State may pose a veto for a second time here
- Once all MS have ratified the agreement, the State becomes a member of the EU
- Overall, it is a complex procedure, but the MS tend to control it, which makes sense

## 1:11:20 Question: when does the institutional part of the procedure end?

- The institutional part of the procedure ends with the closure by the Commission of all the chapters of negotiation
- It's possibile to start the second state with the negotiation of a treaty 

## 1:12:48 Suspension of free movement of workers

- It's possible to have a transition period to avoid any possible problems with the new country joining the EU
- E.g., very often, the accession treaties concluded with new States provide for a transitional period of time, for the free movement of workers
- During that period, the new MS is not entitled to apply or invoke the free movement of workers
- Under EU law, nationals seeking a job, or acceptign a job in a foreign country, may move freely, and they are subject to the national treatment of other workers, and there can't be any discrimination
- This freedom is frozen for a period of time, usually 7 years, for new countries
- The period is meant to allow the new MS to finalize the reforms to their economy and working conditions, so that they don't need to worry about workers leaving the country, or flooding into another

## 1:17:52 Transitional period for the Schengen agreement 

- The Schengen agreement is a cooperation treaty included in the EU treaties to eliminate controls over internal movement of EU citizens
- The Schengen acquis must also be respected and implemented by new MS
- Accession treaties often provide for a transition period related to the Schengen mechanism 
- Border controls are still in place during the transition period
- The State must be able to demonstrate a strong border control over its external borders (with non-EU countries)
- Since there are no internal controls, weak external border would be an issue
- The decision to terminate the transitional period has no deadline, and it is a political decision taken by the council, after they assess the ability of the country to manage its external border
- These two instruments are meant to give the MS sufficient time,so that their accession into the EU won't disturb other MS

## 1:22:57 Are new MS equal to existing ones?

- Question: once a State becomes a MS, is that country equal to other countries (save for these exceptions)?
- In other words, is there a difference between the six original State, and the ones who decided to join later?
- Answer: from a formal point of view, they are all equal; the relevant differences are in the degree of development a country had before joining the Union
- There are cohesion policies and regional policies trying to eliminate these inequalities, but that's at the substantive level

## 1:27:00 Principle of equality of States

- Art. 4 par. 2 states that all States are equal before treates; this is a traditional, fundamental principle of international law
- The fact all States are equal is the main reason an international community exist
- The origin of international law can be conventionally traced back to the Peace of Westfalia in 1648
- This principle has been adapted into EU law with some exceptions
- There are forms of differentiated integration, but they do not violate the principle of equality of States
- The new MS must be considered equal to the existing MS, except for any distinction made in the accession treaty
- However, those distinctions were taken by all MS unanimously
