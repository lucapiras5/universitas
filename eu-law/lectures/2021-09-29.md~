## 1:29 Status of the accession treaties

- The conclusion of an accession treaty is required for a new State to join the EU
- The accession treaty has the same status as EU primary law
- E.g., it may specify the number of seats in the Parliament for the new member, and so it must enjoy the same rank as other primary law instruments

## 2:20 Kosovo as a potential candidate

- The state of the art concering possibile member States
- There are three different categories of States
- "Potential candidates" are States who are able to start the enlargement process (e.g. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo)
- In the case of Kosovo, it has not submitted an application to become a member, but it has concluded a stabilization and association agreement
- The fact that Kosovo is a party to a stabilization agreement doesn't mean that the EU or its MS consider it a State
- Kosovo's declaration of independence is not inconsistent with intl. law, but its existence doesn't mean that Kosovo is an independent State
- States require a population, territory and government

## 7:00 States that have submitted an application

- There are States that have submitted an application
- With regards to those States, the decision has been taken to open the negotiation
- The Council has adopted a decision by unanimity, and the Commission has the chance to analyze the different chapters of the acquis
- These States are Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia

## 7:34 States that have started the negotiations

- They are already in the middle of negotiations with the Commission in order to close the different chapters
- There are three countries that have reached that stage (Turkey, Montenegro and Serbia)

## 8:34 Introduction to the lesson's topic

- Two case studies will be analyzed
- They are related to the interaction between MS of the EU, and candidate countries, and how the enlargement process can influence the interactions between States, and the attitude of countries

## 11:07 Dispute between Slovenia and Croatia

- The first case is related to a dispute between Slovenia and Croatia
- Slovenia acceded in 2004, Croatia in 2013, and both countries were established after the dissolution of Yugoslavia
- There is a long-standing dispute between the two countries regarding the definition of territorial and maritime borders, especially regarding the Gulf of Piran
- In 2009, while Croatia was still a candidate country, a decision was taken to try and solve the dispute through an arbitration agreement
- The two countries decided to conclude a bilateral arbitration agreement, under the auspice of the EU, to solve the issue before the accession into the Union
- A border dispute could jeopardize the implementation of EU law, in the areas concerned by the dispute
- According to the arbitration agreement, an arbitration tribunal had to be appointed, in order to adopt a binding arbitral award.

## 21:50 Slovenia brings Croatia before the CoJ

- In 2019, Slovenia brings Croatia before the EU CoJ
- The infringement procedure is an enforcement mechanism, a judicial one
- It allows the CoJ to assess whether or not a MS is fulfilling its obligations
- At the end of the procedure, the Court gives a judgement with a declaratory nature, that can confirm or deny the presence of a violation
- This procedure can be initiated by MS, or the Commission
- In the vast majority of cases, the Commission brings States before the Court
- States rarely do because they're interested in keeping good relations among themselves
- Slovenia's argument was that Croatia has violated the decision of a tribunal, that was established under a bilateral arbitration treaty
- In so doing, it's impossibile to effectively implement EU law and enforce its obligations in the areas concerned by this dispute, because it's unclear which authority (Slovenian or Croatian) is supposed to do that

## 26:22 Croatia's argument

- On the other hand, Croatia argued in front of the EU CoJ was that the Vienna convention was invocable, and that's why they withdrew from the arbitration court
- In any case, the EU is not concerned, it's a bilateral international treaty, concluded between Croatia and Slovenia, outside the context of the EU
- Therefore, the agreement between Slovenia and Croatia should be regulated by intl. law, not EU law, and the CoJ has no jurisdiction

## 27:43 First ever territorial dispute between two MS

- The CoJ had to solve the dispute, based on these arguments
- This was the first time that the CoJ was asked to deal with a dispute between two MS concerning their borders
- It's not the first time the CoJ had to consider disputes regarding territorial situation
- E.g., it once had to take a position on the origin of products from the self-proclaimed Northern Turkish Republic in Cyprus
- This is the first time that the dispute is between MS
- Ultimately, the court decided to deny its jurisdiction

## 31:29 The Court's first argument

- The Court states that it can only asses the respect of EU law by MS
- In this case, the violation of EU law is a consequence of previous violations, which are at the international law level, because they were related to the first arbitration agreement
- The violations were related to the arbitration agreement, and the arbitration award
- However, the EU was not a party to that agreement, only Croatia and Slovenia were

## 34:06 The Court's second argument

- The definition of the border of a MS is a MS's own prerogative
- It is outside the competence of the EU, which cannot say a word about the MS's decision
- Consequently, the Court can't step beyond the powers conferred by the treaties, and encroach upon the powers reserved for MS regarding the geographical determination of their borders

## 36:08 Summary of the Court's arguments

- The first argument is that it's an intl. law instrument adopted by the two countries, outside the legal system of the EU
- The second argument is that treaties made between MS are related to the exercise of sovereign powers by MS, which aren't covered by EU law
- Therefore, the CoJ has no jurisdiction on something that isn't covered by EU law

## 36:50 Questions ...

- ...

## 38:52 Question: relevance of the controversy about the border?

- Why was Croatia accepted into the EU, despite the controversy about the border?
- Wouldn't not having well-defined borders not be consistent with art. 49 TUE?
- It is consistent, because what intl. law requires is to have "more or less" defined borders
- E.g. in Israel's case, despite the UN's SC's resolutions regarding the border, there are still problems
- In Slovenia and Croatia's case, the issue was about a few kilometers, so it was irrelevant for intl. law purposes
- As far as the exact borders are concerned, that's not an EU issue, but an issue that must be resolved by the States that are concerned

## 43:10 Question: origin of the controversy?

- Croatia took that position because it was discovered that there was a contact between the Slovenian-appointed arbitrator and the Slovenian agent in the procedure before the tribunal
- Therefore, there was a concrete risk for Croatia that the tribunal would be biased towards Slovenia

## 44:16 Question: art. 273 TFEU?

- What about art. 273 of the TFEU, that says that the CoJ shall have jurisdiction in any dispute between MS which relates to the subject matter of treaties if the dispute is submitted under a special agreement between the parties?
- (Will be answered later)
