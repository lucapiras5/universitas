- *00:00:00*.
- There is an article in EU primary law, art. 7 TEU, which was considered the main tool available to deal with this situation.
- However, due to the procedural requirements, and the reputation of the article, the EU judges have tried to elaborate other mechanisms.
- Regarding the political institutions, the idea was to introduce mechanisms in order to strengthen the dialogue with the concerned parties.
- E.g. the mechanisms put in place by the EU Commission, or the the dialogue on the rule of law by EU Council, in both cases try to create a cooperation platform with the concerned MS.
- On the other side, the position taken by the EUCJ can be distinguished in two different approaches.
- The first one was more traditional, it tried downsizing the violation of fundamental values as a violation of ordinary law, such as in the case of Commission v. Hungary (2012).
- Then, there was a shift, in the last judgements the infringement procedure is maintained as a mechanism that can be used to scrutinized the erspect by MS of the rule of law obligations.
- *00:03:00*.
- In particular, the rule of law obligations from art. 19 TEU, which specify the fundamental values found in art. 2 TEU.
- Art. 2 in itself is not sufficient to assess the respect of EU law, and a more specific provision is needed.
- In the case of Polish judges, this "specific" provision was art. 19.
- There are other limitations in this approach.
- There needs to be a concrete infringement, it's not possible to evaluate the risk of a violation.
- Specific provisions that expand the values found in art. 2 must be found.
- E.g., art. 49 TEU regulates the accession obligations, and is governed by the principle of non-regression.
- *00:06:00*.
- The principle means that MS are required to respect fundamental values in the same way they were required to respect them at the beginning.
- It may be possible in the future to bring a State before the CJEU for an infringement procedure, based on art. 2 TEU read in conjunction with art. 49 TEU.
- There is a new instrument, launched in 2020.
- *00:09:00*.
- In July 2020, there was a meeting of the European Council, where the heads of State and government are gathered together.
- It was a difficult meeting, but eventually the Council agreed to launch the "Next Generation EU".
- The MS, in order to obtain funds and financial support, shall ensure the proper respect of the rule of law.
- In late 2020, Hungary and Poland made a common statement.
- *00:12:00*.
- They voiced their concerns about the functioning of the mechanisms, and some details contained in the common statement.
- They were the 2021 budget and the multiannual financial framework, which is a decision adopted every 7 years by the EU, to plan the use of the budget.
- The annual budget and multi-annual financial framework are adopted by unanimity, and each MS could pose a veto.
- The issue is particularly evident with the next generation EU agreement.
- Poland and Hungary threatened that if the regulation contained a conditionality mechanism, based on the respect of the rule of law, they would block the budget/plan.
- *00:15:00*.
- Negotiations were started, and an agreement was reached in the EU council of December 2020.
- The decision was taken to adopt a Regulation, introducing a conditionality mechanism on the respect of the rule of law (Regulation 2020/2092).
- The annual budget and multi-annual financial framework were adopted too.
- It may seem like both Next Generation EU and Regulation 2020/2092 were adopted, but in reality, things are different.
- The Regulation has a very specific scope of application, it introduces a conditionality mechanism for the protection of the rule of law, only with regards to the financial interests and budget of the EU.
- *00:18:00*.
- In other words, rule of law breaches that are relevant under that Regulation must be related to the financial interests and budget of the Union.
- If it's not possible to find a link with those topics, it's not possible to use that mechanism, it's not an instrument that can be applied to general violations of rule of law.
- E.g., if there are some reforms regarding the judiciary, and risk jeopardizing its impartiality, in order to protect the budget of the Union, and its financial interests, the regulation may be triggered.
- There is a second element, a procedural one.
- The European Commission could propose to the Council the adoption of some measures against the State concerned.
- E.g., the possibility to suspend funds, the signature of a grant, etc.
- *00:21:00*.
- The Commission "may" (not "shall") do so, it's a discretionary power, and the Council too has a discretionary power in deciding whether to adopt the Commission's proposal.
- The States have the last word, because the Council is composed by States.
- This mechanism is reproducing art. 7 TEU, because in both cases the Council may adopt a measure, following a proposal that the Commission may produce, and in both cases there's broad discretionality.
- The State concerned by the measures doesn't participate in the procedure.
- *00:24:00*.
- The "Conclusions" are the final document produced at the end of the meeting of the European Council.
- It's not a binding document, it only details the political engagements that the Council has decided to adopt.
- In the December 2020 Conclusion, the Council states that art. 7 TEU should still be considered the main instrument to deal with breaches of rule of law, or other fundamental values, despite its ineffectiveness.
- *00:27:00*.
- The Council is introducing some guiding principles in how the conditionality mechanism should be implemented.
- The national identities clause mean that EU institutions should take into account the prerogatives of MS when implementing the Regulation.
- They also have to consider the principle of conferral (art. 4(1) TEU), and the principle of equality and non-discrimination among MS (art. 4(2) TEU).
- The Council is referencing principles that are more MS-oriented, there is no reference to the principle of sincere cooperation.
- The EU is stressing the elements in art. 4 TEU which have been introduced, in order to protect the prerogatives of the MS.
- *00:30:00*.
- The Council states that the Commission should prepare guidelines to apply the conditionality mechanism, in close consultation with the MS.
- Until such guidelines are finalized, the Commission won't propose measures under the Regulation.
- In other words, without the guidelines, the Regulation is binding and in force, but it can't be applied, and the guidelines must be taken in accordance with MS.
- It seems as if the EU Council is deciding what the Commission can do.
- *00:33:00*.
- However, this shouldn't be possible, since the Commission is an autonomous institution, the constitutional balance must be protected, every EU institution should act within its mandate.
- The second problem is that the Council predicted that a State may bring the Regulation before the CJEU to assess its validity.
- In that case, the guidelines of the EU Commission can't be adopted until the Court has decided.
- In March 2021, Poland and Hungary decided to bring the Regulation before the CJEU, because the Regulation is inconsistent with art. 4(2) TEU and art. 7 TEU.
- *00:36:00*.
- The Regulation is seen as a way to circumvent art. 7 TEU.
- Due to the pending case, the Commission can't draft the guidelines, and in average, the Court takes 16 months to deliver a judgement.
- *00:39:00*.
- Even after the judgement, it's going to take a long time to work through the rest of the procedure, so the Regulation is /de facto/ ineffective.
- The President of the EU Parliament asked the legal service of the Parliament to consider the possibility to bring the EU Council before the EUCJ for failing to fulfil its obligations under the Regulation on the conditionality mechanism.
- The President's argument is that the Commission should act, it shouldn't wait.
- There's nothing in the Regulation forcing the Commission to adopt guidelines, or suspending the process if there's a pending judgement.
- It is possible to bring EU institutions before the CJEU for failure to fulfil their obligations under the treaties.
- However, there are problems, because this is an action for failure to fulfil an obligation.
- *00:42:00*.
- The EU Commission is not under an obligation to provide these measures, it may propose measures, so it can't be brought before the Court for deciding not to adopt measures.
- The Commission enjoys and is exercising their discretionary power, and the Court would most likely reject the Parliament's request.
- It seems impossible to find a way to sanctions the violations of the fundamental values of the EU by MS, especially the rule of law.
- The Constitutional Court of Poland took a controversial decision.
- *00:45:00*.
- According to the decision, art. 1 TEU (the creation of the EU), together with art. 4(3) TEU (the principle of sincere cooperation) shall be considered inconsistent with the Polish constitution, under two conditions.
- If the EU institutions act /ultra vires/ (outside their mandate) in order to fulfil the EU objectives.
- If the Constitution of Poland is longer the supreme law of the country.
- Therefore, if Poland can't be considered, as a result, a democratic and sovereign country.
- *00:48:00*.
- This isn't the first time that the Constitutional Court of a MS considers the actions of EU institutions to be /ultra vires/, and as such, not binding upon the State.
- Recently, the Danish Supreme Court declared that the EUCJ acted /ultra vires/ in interpreting a Directive on working conditions, in a way that was inconsistent with the Danish legal system.
- As a consequence of that, the decision was taken not to respect the judgement given by the EUCJ.
- In May 2020, the German Constitutional Court adopted a similar attitude, with regards to a judgement regarding the validity of the quantitative easing of the ECB, whose real name is "public sector purchase program".
- The EUCJ was requested to assess the legality of that instrument, and declared it to be lawful.
- *00:51:00*.
- In response to that, the German SC stated that the EUCJ acted /ultra vires/ in assessing the validity of quantitative easing, and so the judgement wasn't binding.
- Around that time, there was another purchase program for the pandemic, which was similar to the public sector purchase program.
- There were concerns about the decisions taken by the ECB to aid the economies of the States in the euro zone.
- Judgements by Constitutional or Supreme Courts which claim that the EU institutions acted /ultra vires/ show a bilateral understanding of the relations between the MS and the EU and its institutions.
- Once a State is a MS, one needs to consider the relations between that State and the other MS, and the consequences that the conduct of a single State may produce on others, because of integration.
- It's no longer a bilateral situation, but a multilateral one, and if one focuses only on the bilateral attitudes, they completely miss out on the more articulated dimension of EU law.
- *00:54:00*.
- By only relying on national law, multilateral relations become bilateral one, and this can have effects on other MS.
- E.g., the German Supreme Court decided the issue according to German law, but without taking into account the effects of that decision on the other MS.
- The public purchase program is a general program, and it represents one of most powerful tools introduced to protect the euro zone.
- In the case of the Polish case, there is another element, the context. It's clear that the State is showing a progressive detachment from the fundamental values of the EU.
- *00:57:00*.
- This is another element in a larger scheme by Poland, which doesn't fit with the EU integration process.
- Could the Polish Supreme Court judgement be considered an implicit exit from the EU?
- Could the Polish SC considered a political body at this point?
- *01:00:00*.
- There are some scholars in Poland who considered the SC to be no longer a court, but a law-making body.
- Some scholars have argued that this was a /de facto/ triggering of art. 50 TEU.
- *01:03:00*.
- Art. 50 doesn't allow a /de facto/ withdrawal, and such a withdrawal shouldn't be possible, for at least two reasons.
- The ratio behind art. 50 is creating a process that guarantees an orderly withdrawal from the Union, since the rights of individuals have to be taken into consideration.
- A /de facto/ withdrawal is the opposite of an orderly withdrawal, since it's not clear who is responsible for dealing with assessing whether the intention to withdraw is present.
- It's not for the EU institutions, since according to the Wightman case, leaving the EU is a prerogative of individual States, it's up to them to decide.
- In any case, the Polish SC is not an organ who can decide whether to leave the Union.
- Art. 50 is not applicable to implied or /de facto/ withdrawals, what is needed is an act, taken by the organs of the State who are able to define the position of that State in the international community.
- There have been statements by the PM of Poland, saying that Poland is still a MS and doesn't intend to leave the Union.
- *01:06:00*.
- If EU law is unable to find a solution, it's possible to go back to international law to find solutions to emergency situations.
- If one considers the economic and financial crisis and the decision taken by the MS to adopt the European Stability Mechanism, it was outside of the EU legal order, by means of international law.
- The EU legal order was unable to identify the tools and instruments capable to provide assistance, so States went back to international law, it's not unusual.
- According to art. 60 VCLT (the material breach clause), when there is a violation by a contracting party of substantive obligations flowing from a treaty, the other parties can consider it grounds for the suspension or termination of the treaty.
- *01:09:00*.
- If Poland violates the fundamental value of the Union, the other MS could consider that situation as grounds for suspension or termination of the EU treaties with regards to Poland.
- The first issue is at the level of international law.
- Art. 60 VCLT also states that the article doesn't apply to provisions relating to the protection of the human person, in treaties with a humanitarian character.
- According to international law, "humanitarian law" is law related to wars and conflicts.
- IHL (International Humanitarian Law) is the set of rules adopted at the international level to govern the use of military force, and the way in which it may be used.
- It's called "humanitarian" because its purpose is to protect individuals, whenever possible.
- According to a literal interpretation of this clause, only IHL instruments can't be subject to the art. 60 VCLT exception.
- *01:12:00*.
- However, this clause has been interpreted in a broader way, to include human rights instruments.
- In this case, there is an issue, since EU primary law includes the charter of fundamental rights of the EU.
