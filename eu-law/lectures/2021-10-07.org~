** Question: the role of conditionality mechanisms w.r.t. the enlargement process.

- *00:00:00*.
- Question: clarify the conditionality mechanism with regards to the enlargement process.
- There were two cases, between Croatia and Slovenia, and Turkey and Cyprus, and in both cases, international law was used to solve the issue.
- Between Croatia and Slovenia, an arbitration agreement was concluded outside of the EU legal order.
- Furthermore, the definition of a State's borders is a State prerogative, with which the EU can't interfere.
- Between Turkey and Cyprus, there is a violation of the sovereingty of Cyprus, according to international law, so the response uses international law instruments, such as sanctions.
- In both cases, the enlargement process wasn't mentioned, and it doesn't seem to be able to change the attitude of candidate countries towards other Member States.
- *00:03:00*.
- The conditionality mechanism of this process, related to the assistance that the EU can provide to these countries, aren't able to influence the attitude of candidate countries.

** Summary of the previous lecture.

- The principles governing the interactions between the EU and MS are found in art. 4 TEU.
- They are the principle of conferral, of equality, and national identities.
- In particular, regarding the definition  of national identities, there are a lot of issues regarding their exact content, and the subjects who are allowed to define their content.
- *00:06:00*.
- In some EUCJ cases, it seems like MS can invoke the national identity clause only as long as the national identity is consistent with the fundamental elements of the EU legal order.
- It's possible to have contrasts between the EUCJ and national supreme courts, and the only way to resolve this conflict is by establishing a genuine dialogue.
- E.g., in the Taricco cases, the Constituional court of Italy and the EUCJ collaborated to reach an agreement.
- Eventually, the EUCJ conceded the possibility to invoke the country's national identity.
- In the first instance ruling, in which it applied a very strict interpretation of the primacy of EU law.
- It's hard to foresee a conclusion, also due to the lack of case law, since the clause was introduced with the Lisbon treaty
- *00:09:00*.
- The existing case law isn't focused on defining a general principle, but only solving the current case, which makes it even harder to develop a general doctrine.
- Art. 4 par. 2 TEU mentions three fields which the Union can't interfere with ("ensuring the territorial integrity", "maintaining law and order", and "safeguarding national security").
- In particular, national security is the sole responsibility of Member States, meaning that the EU can't influce how MS act in order to promote national security.
- *00:12:00*.
- However, in practice, this is not true.
- There's a 2020 case regarding some decisions in the context of the refugee crisis.
- In 2015, there was a large movement of refugees from non-EU States into EU MS, which took place illegally, and was a result of the Syrian war and the political situation in Libya.
- *00:15:00*.
- Due to the situation, there was the need to provide relief to the MS which were most affected from this migration, which were in particular, Italy and Greece, due to their geographical position.
- According to the criteria in the Dublin Regulation, which identify the MS which is responsible for asylum claims.
- The main criterion in the Dublin Regulation is related to a situation of illegal entrance into the territory of the EU.
- If a third-country national enters into a EU MS, that State is responsible for handling the asylum request presented by the individual.
- Even if the subject may move to another State, and submit the request for asylum there, it's the State of first entrance who has the duty to process to request.
