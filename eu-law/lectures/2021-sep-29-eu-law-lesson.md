## 1:29 Status of the accession treaties

- The conclusion of an accession treaty is required for a new State to join the EU
- The accession treaty has the same status as EU primary law
- E.g., it may specify the number of seats in the Parliament for the new member, and so it must enjoy the same rank as other primary law instruments

## 2:20 Kosovo as a potential candidate

- The state of the art concering possibile member States
- There are three different categories of States
- "Potential candidates" are States who are able to start the enlargement process (e.g. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo)
- In the case of Kosovo, it has not submitted an application to become a member, but it has concluded a stabilization and association agreement
- The fact that Kosovo is a party to a stabilization agreement doesn't mean that the EU or its MS consider it a State
- Kosovo's declaration of independence is not inconsistent with intl. law, but its existence doesn't mean that Kosovo is an independent State
- States require a population, territory and government

## 7:00 States that have submitted an application

- There are States that have submitted an application
- With regards to those States, the decision has been taken to open the negotiation
- The Council has adopted a decision by unanimity, and the Commission has the chance to analyze the different chapters of the acquis
- These States are Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia

## 7:34 States that have started the negotiations

- They are already in the middle of negotiations with the Commission in order to close the different chapters
- There are three countries that have reached that stage (Turkey, Montenegro and Serbia)

## 8:34 Introduction to the lesson's topic

- Two case studies will be analyzed
- They are related to the interaction between MS of the EU, and candidate countries, and how the enlargement process can influence the interactions between States, and the attitude of countries

## ...

## 11:07 Dispute between Slovenia and Croatia

- The first case is related to a dispute between Slovenia and Croatia
- Slovenia acceded in 2004, Croatia in 2013, and both countries were established after the dissolution of Yugoslavia
- There is a long-standing dispute between the two countries regarding the definition of territorial and maritime borders, especially regarding the Gulf of Piran
- In 2009, while Croatia was still a candidate country, a decision was taken to try and solve the dispute through an arbitration agreement
- The two countries decided to conclude a bilateral arbitration agreement, under the auspice of the EU, to solve the issue before the accession into the Union
- A border dispute could jeopardize the implementation of EU law, in the areas concerned by the dispute
- According to the arbitration agreement, an arbitration tribunal had to be appointed, in order to adopt a binding arbitral award.

## 21:50 Slovenia brings Croatia before the CoJ

- In 2019, Slovenia brings Croatia before the EU CoJ
- The infringement procedure is an enforcement mechanism, a judicial one
- It allows the CoJ to assess whether or not a MS is fulfilling its obligations
- At the end of the procedure, the Court gives a judgement with a declaratory nature, that can confirm or deny the presence of a violation
- This procedure can be initiated by MS, or the Commission
- In the vast majority of cases, the Commission brings States before the Court
- States rarely do because they're interested in keeping good relations among themselves
- Slovenia's argument was that Croatia has violated the decision of a tribunal, that was established under a bilateral arbitration treaty
- In so doing, it's impossibile to effectively implement EU law and enforce its obligations in the areas concerned by this dispute, because it's unclear which authority (Slovenian or Croatian) is supposed to do that

## 26:22 Croatia's argument

- On the other hand, Croatia argued in front of the EU CoJ was that the Vienna convention was invocable, and that's why they withdrew from the arbitration court
- In any case, the EU is not concerned, it's a bilateral international treaty, concluded between Croatia and Slovenia, outside the context of the EU
- Therefore, the agreement between Slovenia and Croatia should be regulated by intl. law, not EU law, and the CoJ has no jurisdiction

## 27:43 First ever territorial dispute between two MS

- The CoJ had to solve the dispute, based on these arguments
- This was the first time that the CoJ was asked to deal with a dispute between two MS concerning their borders
- It's not the first time the CoJ had to consider disputes regarding territorial situation
- E.g., it once had to take a position on the origin of products from the self-proclaimed Northern Turkish Republic in Cyprus
- This is the first time that the dispute is between MS
- Ultimately, the court decided to deny its jurisdiction

## 31:29 The Court's first argument

- The Court states that it can only asses the respect of EU law by MS
- In this case, the violation of EU law is a consequence of previous violations, which are at the international law level, because they were related to the first arbitration agreement
- The violations were related to the arbitration agreement, and the arbitration award
- However, the EU was not a party to that agreement, only Croatia and Slovenia were

## 34:06 The Court's second argument

- The definition of the border of a MS is a MS's own prerogative
- It is outside the competence of the EU, which cannot say a word about the MS's decision
- Consequently, the Court can't step beyond the powers conferred by the treaties, and encroach upon the powers reserved for MS regarding the geographical determination of their borders

## 36:08 Summary of the Court's arguments

- The first argument is that it's an intl. law instrument adopted by the two countries, outside the legal system of the EU
- The second argument is that treaties made between MS are related to the exercise of sovereign powers by MS, which aren't covered by EU law
- Therefore, the CoJ has no jurisdiction on something that isn't covered by EU law

## 36:50 Questions ...

- ...

## 38:52 Question: relevance of the controversy about the border?

- Why was Croatia accepted into the EU, despite the controversy about the border?
- Wouldn't not having well-defined borders not be consistent with art. 49 TUE?
- It is consistent, because what intl. law requires is to have "more or less" defined borders
- E.g. in Israel's case, despite the UN's SC's resolutions regarding the border, there are still problems
- In Slovenia and Croatia's case, the issue was about a few kilometers, so it was irrelevant for intl. law purposes
- As far as the exact borders are concerned, that's not an EU issue, but an issue that must be resolved by the States that are concerned

## 43:10 Question: origin of the controversy?

- Croatia took that position because it was discovered that there was a contact between the Slovenian-appointed arbitrator and the Slovenian agent in the procedure before the tribunal
- Therefore, there was a concrete risk for Croatia that the tribunal would be biased towards Slovenia

## 44:16 Question: art. 273 TFEU?

- What about art. 273 of the TFEU, that says that the CoJ shall have jurisdiction in any dispute between MS which relates to the subject matter of treaties if the dispute is submitted under a special agreement between the parties?
- (Will be answered later)

## 45:21 Agreement about implementing fishery regulations

- The CoJ's arguments about the agreement being between States, and not MS of the EU, and so it existing outside of the EU legal order, and the argument about the sovereign prerogatives of MS concerning the territorial definition is sound
- In the accession treaty Croatia concluded with other MS, there is a reference to the arbitration agreement, specifically in point 5 of Annex 3
- According to that point, the fishery regulations adopted by the EU must be fully implemented, taking into consideration the award resulting from the arbitration

## 49:24 Professor's opinion: failure of enlargement tools

- The position taken by the Court was a missed opportunity, for several reasons
- First, it makes it clear that the enlargement process may not be helpful in changing the attitude of candidate state towards the MS and EU institutions
- The arbitration agreement was adopted because of the enlargement process, and it was mentioned in the accession instruments
- The enlargement tools weren't able to fix that problem before the accession, and the dispute still exists even after Croatia joined the EU

## 51:07 Professor's opinion: CoJ's excessive formalism

- The second element to consider is that the EU's position was highly formalistic
- While it is true that the arbitration agreement was a piece of intl. law, it is also true that it was adopted with the intent to implement EU law
- E.g., the European stability mechanism also was a piece of intl. law, adopted outside the EU legal system, to implement EU law obligations
- Therefore, the CoJ had to consider it, since it was related to the implementation of EU law
- Secondly, regarding the argument that it's the member States' prerogative to define their borders
- States have many other prerogatives as well, but that hasn't stoped the CoJ from intervening
- E.g., when it comes to citizenship law, the CoJ determined that there is a prerogative for MS to define the conditions to acquire and lose their nationality
- However, this prerogative shall be exercised by taking into consideration EU law
- This means that if MS don't take into consideration EU law in the case of citizenship law, national security, public order, the CoJ can intervene
- Therefore, sovereign prerogatives aren't absolute, and have to follow EU law
- Of course, the definition of borders is a very sensitive topic, but the CoJ didn't have to completely ignore it, they could've at least asked that States follow EU law
- This formalistic approach led to an unusual result, the CoJ rarely denies jurisdiction; rather, it affirms it, even when it's not completely appropriate, to prevent States from disregarding EU law

## 56:43 Possibile solution: principle of "sincere cooperation" and art. 273 TFEU

- There was another solution, the court could refuse to exercise its jurisdiction, but the States are still obliged to respect the principle of sincere cooperation
- The exact content of "sincere cooperation" is vague, but it entails resolving the conflict, either through intl. law instruments, or by giving the CoJ the jurisdiction to solve the dispute (through art. 273 TFEU)

## 1:00:18 Cyprus and Turkey case

- There is a recent dispute between Cyprus and Turkey regardign the driling activities in the Eastern Mediterranean sea
- Cyprus is de-facto divided in two parts
- The Southern part, where the legitimate government is located, is under the jurisdiction of the EU legal order, and Cyprus is a MS of the EU
- The northern part is under the jurisdiction of the self-proclaimed Northern Turkish Republic, which is considered a puppet State controlled by Turkey by the ECHR
- Recently Turkey decided to carry out drilling activities in the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus, with the aim to map gas reservoirs in the continental shelf of the Mediterranean sea
- These activities violate international law, since Turkey didn't obtain permission from Cyprus to carry out that kind of activity
- Turkey is also a candidate State, who has opened the negotiations, which are still ongoing, while Cyprus is a member State

## 1:03:27 Position taken by the EU

- In this case, the EU invoked intl. law to stress the unlawfulness of Turkey's behavior, but it made no references to the enlargement process
- There was a breach of the sovereignty of Cyprus, and in response the EU decided to adopt economic sanctions against Turkey
- Sanctions are the classical instrument used at the intl. level to pressure a country into changing its behavior
- They can be adopted under a UN framework, or unilaterally
- The EU decided to adopt sanctions unilaterally
- It was the first time that the Union adopted sanctions against a candidate country, and it's bizarre that they used an intl. law instrument against a State that is fully involved in the enlargement process
- The EU could've used enlargement conditionality mechanisms in order to try and convince Turkey to change its attitude

## 1:06:26 Second failure of the enlargement process

- Again, it seems as though the enlargement process is not effective in terms of changing the behavior of countries towards MS and the EU as a whole
- It's not surprising if one considers what is happening in some Eastern European MS
- The conditionality mechanisms provided for in the enlargement process aren't very effective
- E.g., the position of Poland and Hungary, it's evident that there were problems tracing back to the enlargement process, which were unsolved
- In both cases, there is an evident shift from EU law to intl. law

## 1:08:00 Question: why did the EU have authority to impose sanctions on Turkey, but not solve the Slovenian/Croatian dispute?

- In the Slovenia and Croatia case, there is an issue of EU law infringement brought before the CoJ
- The Court reasoned that there was no infringement of EU law, but only of intl. law, over which the CoJ has no jurisdiction
- In the Turkey and Cyprus case, we have a situation where the CoJ was asked to intervene by Cyprus, the EU recognized that there was a breach of Cyprus' sovereignty, and adopted sanctions
- The EU can also adopt sanctions towards other States, such as China, because of their violation of human rights
- These are not EU law obligations, but intl. law obligations, and the EU, just like any other actor at the intl. levle, if it maintains that there is a violation of intl. law obligations
