# 11. The internal market and the philosophies of market integration (334)

## 1. Introduction (334)

- **European market**:
  - Its creation has always been at the heart of the European integration project.
  - The Treaties call it "internal market".
  - Its nature is unclear, and has evolved over time.
  - Art. 26(2) TFEU defines it in terms of the four freedoms (an area without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured).

## 2. The nature of the internal market: three models (335)

- All markets need:
  - Freedom: suppliers need to be able to buy and sell products.
  - Rules: to determine what can be sold and bought, property rights and contracts, health and safety requirements, etc.
- EU internal market:
  - Freedom: four EU freedoms (goods, persons, services, capital).
  - Rules: there are several possible models.

### 2.1. Three models of market integration (335)

- Ideal models:
  - There are three models to organize the internal market.
  - They do not exist in a pure form, each has implications for the EU-MS and MS-MS relationships.
- Host country control:
  - The rules of the country where the economic activity takes place apply.
  - It's the normal situation in trade between independent countries.
  - In the EU, host country control is limited by the non-discrimination rule.
- Harmonized model:
  - The EU creates a single, unitary rule for each issue.
  - Products and factors of production that comply with it can be traded in the territory of the whole Union.
- Home country control:
  - It's the opposite of the host country control model.
  - The rules of the country of origin apply.
  - The mutual recognition of rules requires a high level of trust between countries.
  - Where it applies in practice, it's tempered with exceptions to allow the host country to deny recognition.

### 2.2. Implications of the different models (336)

#### Consequences for sovereignty (336)

- Host country control: preserves sovereignty, with the only exception of the non-discrimination rule.
- Harmonized model: MS exercise their sovereignty jointly through the EU institutions in certain affairs.
- Home country control: sovereignty is reassigned in certain matters to another MS.

#### Institutional consequences (337)

- Host country control:
  - National legislatures: play a dominant role.
  - Judiciary: their influence depends on how the non-discrimination rule is applied, and whether and to what degree it covers indirect or covert discrimination.
 - Harmonized model:
   - EU legislature: plays a dominant role.
   - National judiciary: can also engage in harmonization by striking down rules that restrict the four freedoms.
 - Home country control model:
   - National judiciary: plays the dominant role, it ensures that mutual recognition takes place, and evaluates exceptions to mutual recognition.

#### Welfare considerations (338)

- Welfare: each model aims at improving the welfare of societies in different ways.
- Host country control:
  - Allows trade to take place, which in itself makes the participants wealthier.
  - Allows each country to set their own levels of protection of other interests (e.g. environmental protection).
- Harmonized model:
  - Economic actors need to comply only with one rule, which reduces compliance and transaction costs and allows for mass production of goods.
  - A unified market would allow Europe to compete with countries with large internal markets, such as the US or China.
  - However, it requires satisfying all MS' preferences, the legislature may not be able to produce rules of sufficient quality and quantity, and EU law is hard to adopt and amend.
- Home country control:
  - It introduces regulatory competition, where each MS tries to attract valuable assets, and economic actors are free to choose.
  - It increases choice, allows for regulatory experimentation, and can counteracts excessive taxes or oppressive rules from public officials.
  - At the same time, there are externalities, and competition between MS could lead to countries competitively lowering their standards of labor or economic protection to attract capital.

#### Democratic concerns (340)

- Host country model: laws are created by the citizens of the Host State, and while they affect foreigners from other MS, they don't take into account their interests.
- Harmonized model: it's vulnerable to the same criticisms as the EU law-making process.
- Home country model: it favors capital (which is more mobile) over workers (who are less mobile).
- In practice: the nature of the internal market has fluctuated.

## 3. Nature of the internal market: the historical experience (341)

- Common market paradigm: market regulated by the EU, similar to the harmonized model.
- Single market paradigm: replaced the common market paradigm between the 70's and 80's, the EUCJ became a more important actor, it shifted towards the home country control model, but has proven itself to be unstable and weak.
- Denominations:
  - The original Treaty of Rome used the term "common market", the SEA used "internal market", and political discussions used "single market".
  - The Court used all three expression interchangeably, to mean the same thing, even though legal scholars insist that they are different concepts.

### 3.1. Common market (341)

- European integration:
  - Previous attempts: the European Defence and Political Communities were not ratified.
  - Creation of a common market: was chosen as a way to drive integration.
- Spaak Report:
  - Objective: merge markets to arrest the international decline of Europe.
  - Proposed actions: suppress obstacles to trade, distortions of competition, help underdeveloped regions.
- EEC Treaty:
  - Goods: provision on the elimination of customs duties and quotas, and measures of equivalent effect.
  - Persons and services: establishment of a framework for liberalization.
  - Distortions of competition: a harmonization mechanism was created.
  - Commission: was charged with applying competition law and policing State aid.
  - Economic policies: were partially coordinated, the European Social Fund and the European Investment Bank were created to aid the workforce and underdeveloped regions.
- Harmonized model:
  - Initial success: markets were opened in a controlled fashion, the process resulted in fair competition.
  - Crisis: the empty chair crisis in the 60's required unanimity in Council decisions, non-tariff barriers proved to be difficult to remove, new developments meant that EU rules had to be revised frequently.

### 3.2. Single market (343)

- European Court of Justice:
  - Four freedoms: a series of cases in the early 70's found them directly applicable, with the exception of capital.
  - Principle of mutual recognition: was created by the Court, mandated that host countries must accept goods on their market, if they meet the requirements of their home country, unless there is a good reason to block market access, and the measure is proportional.
- Home country model:
  - SEA: set out the aim to achieve the internal market by 1992.
  - New approach: use harmonization sparingly, for the cases that survived the direct application of the Treaty, and even then only to establish essential requirements.
- Advantages:
  - Pragmatic: it abandoned the unachievable goal of complete harmonization and allowed for experimentation and local differences.
  - Functional: by 1992 it existed in a workable form.
- Disadvantages:
  - National authorities: can deny mutual recognition, and challenging their opposition for being disproportionate requires expensive, unpredictable litigation.
  - Public opinion: will blame the national governments for harmful products, even though the latter has lost the ability to regulate products.
  - National companies: will be harmed by foreign competition, but State aid to national companies is likely to be illegal under EU competition law.
  - Advocates of further integration: the single market lacked emotional pull, and didn't inspire Euro-patriotism.
  - Enlargements: heightened competition, especially if the labor-cost difference between countries were significant.
- Reactions:
  - Commission: has abandoned the attempt to liberalize services markets, returned to the harmonization approach.
  - Emphasis: on social issues to try and win over citizens, and a more "fair" market.

### 3.3. Economic union? (347)

- New paradigm shift: the single market paradigm is giving way to an economic union paradigm.
- Single market: is complemented by the EMU.
- Issues with a single currency: it only makes sense in the context of a single market, MS become highly interconnected.
- Issues with financial services: during crises they repatriate, they are regulated and rescued by their home States, despite operating on a pan-European scale.
- New financial services rules: have abandoned the idea of home country control, moved to a centralized approach.
- Evolution over time:
  - Common market: political institutions would use harmonization to balance freedom and fairness, but they were unable to keep up.
  - Single market: the Court, Commission and MS created a single market based on home country control and competition, but it's inherently unstable.
  - Economic Union: is the result of the failure of the single market, and the need to support the EMU.

### Case study 11.1: Internal market as a source of legitimacy and discontent (351)

- Internal market: isn't a purely technical project, it reflects political choices.
- Commission:
  - "Europe of results": focus on producing tangible benefits for the citizens, rather than advancing the market for the sake of efficiency.
  - Risk: expectations are not met, legitimacy is harmed.
- Brexit:
  - Migrant workers: entered the British labor market thanks relying on EU freedoms.
  - UK: was not not willing to grant free movement of workers, left the EU and the EEA.
  - Alternative methods of market access: Switzerland (bilateral agreements, most areas are covered), Turkey (free flow of goods but not persons), Canada (comprehensive economic and trade agreement).
- Conclusion:
  - Legitimation of the internal market: generating wealth is not enough, the Commission focused on projects that create tangible results.
  - Social divisions: can be made worse by the internal market.

## 4. Law of the internal market: the power to harmonize (354)

- Internal market: requires rules on free movement, and a rule that allows the EU to legislate for internal market purposes.
- Art. 114 TEU: is the most important rule on the internal market.

### 4.1. Power (354)

- Art. 114 TFEU: allows the approximation of the provisions in MS which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market.
- Residual provision: can only be used if other legal bases are not available.
- OLP: it uses majority voting in the Council, except for some sensitive matters (fiscal provisions, free movement of persons, rights and interests of employed persons).
- "Measures": the legislature can choose the legal instrument, and isn't limited only to directives.
- Scope:
  - Almost every provision has the potential to affect the internal market, so the EU's authority must be constrained.
  - Measures adopted under art. 114 TFEU must either eliminate obstacles to the internal market, or deal with appreciable distortions of competition.
- Swedish Match case:
  - A Directive adopted under art. 114 banned all tobacco for oral use, except tobacco for chewing or smoking.
  - This banned also "snus", a type of tobacco placed between the lips and gum that is popular in Sweden.
  - It was argued that the ban of a product could not advance the internal market.
  - The Court replied that national laws on tobacco for oral use were developing in divergent directions, which was creating obstacles to trade, and so justified EU action, which can even ban a certain type of product, if appropriate.
- Practical limits of art. 114 TFEU: are very wide in practice.

#### Case study 11.2: Tobacco advertising (356)

- Tobacco advertising: was regulated by a directive in 1998, which banned all tobacco advertising on the basis of art. 114 TFEU.
- Germany: tried to challenge the directive by framing it as a health protection measure, since the Treaty excluded harmonization for the protection of human health.
- Court:
  - Denied Germany's argument, since health requirements have to be taken into account in all EU policies (art. 114(3) TFEU), and market regulations can have an effect on non-market issues.
  - Found that art. 114 doesn't give the EU a general competence to regulate the internal market, because this would violate the principle of conferred powers.
  - Previously States could use vetoes, but with majority voting the matter of competence becomes much more important.
- Art. 114 provides the power to:
  - Establish the internal market (eliminate obstacles to free movement).
  - Improve its functioning (eliminate distortions of competition).
- Obstacles to free movement:
  - The scope of art. 114 depends on how wide the notion of "obstacle" is.
  - Future obstacles to trade can be eliminated as well, but only if their emergence is likely.
  - The directive was too far-reaching in what it banned, and didn't provide for the free movement of products that did conform with it, so that MS could ban those too.
- Distortions of competition:
  - Only the elimination of appreciable distortions can justify the recourse to art. 114 TFEU.
  - The directive went much further, but the Court stated that while advertising agencies in countries with fewer restrictions may have a competitive advantage, the effects were too remote to be deemed appreciable.
- Result:
  - The Court annulled the Tobacco Advertising Directive, and for the first time a EU measure was struck for lack of competence.
  - A few years later, a new Directive was adopted, Germany challenged it again, but since it had a more limited reach the Court allowed it to stand.

### 4.1. (continued) (358)

- Approximation:
  - The EU can only approximate existing laws, regulations or administrative actions, it can't create something new that is unrelated to existing or anticipated national laws.
  - E.g., national company laws were approximated using art. 114, while the European limited company form was established using art. 352 TFEU.
- ENISA case:
  - The European Network and Information Security Agency was an EU body with the purpose of enhancing cooperation in the internal market, established on the basis of art. 114.
  - The UK argued that art. 114 only allowed for the harmonization of existing measures, not the creation of new bodies.
  - The Court replied that the agency was valid, as long as its tasks would help the uniform implementation and application of other harmonizing measures, and its tasks were closely related to competences the EU already had.
  - Otherwise, art. 352 TFEU would have to be used, but it requires unanimity.
- ESMA case:
  - During the financial crisis that began in 2007, the EU created a set of supervisory authorities with the power to impose binding decisions.
  - The Court found that art. 114 allowed ESMA to take binding measures directed at specific natural or legal persons, and overriding national decisions.

### 4.2. Exceptions (360)

- Countries with high standards were worried that the majority voting rule in art. 114 would lead to a lowered level of protection.
- Art. 114(4) provides a derogation for pre-existing national rules, provided that:
  - They are protecting one of the subjects listed in art. 36 TFEU.
  - The Commission is notified.
- Art. 114(5) provides a derogation for new national rules adopted after harmonization, if:
  - There is new scientific evidence, related to the environment or working environment.
  - The problem must be specific to the MS, and must have arisen after harmonization.
  - The Commission must be notified.
- Art. 114(6) sets out the procedure that the Commission must follow when it receives a notification:
  - The national measure must be approved or rejected in 6 months.
  - The measure is rejected if it's a means of arbitrary discrimination, or a disguised restriction on trade between MS, and whether it's an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market.
  - If the measure is approved, the Commission must consider whether the existing harmonization measures must be changed.
- It was feared that derogations would be abused, but MS are committed to the internal market, the standards are sufficiently high, and the requirements to use them discourage their abuse.

## 5. Law of the internal market: types of harmonization (361)

- Two paradigmatic types of harmonization under art. 114 are total and minimum harmonization.
- Total harmonization:
  - Was the predominant method of approximation in the early years of the EU, and is still employed today.
  - EU measures regulate something exhaustively, not leaving room for divergent rules by the MS.
  - National rules that complies with EU measure can't be challenged on the basis of the four freedoms of the Treaties, and any challenge would have to demonstrate that the law fails to respect the relevant EU measure.
  - EU harmonizing measures aren't immune to legal scrutiny, and can be challenged on the grounds that they violate a higher-ranking rule or a principle of EU law, but the Courts only strikes down EU measures if they manifestly infringe the Treaty.
- Minimum harmonization:
  - Sets a minimum standards below which States aren't allowed to go, but leaves them free to adopt more demanding rules.
  - National laws that go beyond the minimum standard don't enjoy immunity, and would be open to challenge on the ground that it violates a freedom in the Treaties.
- The distinction between total and minimum harmonization can be difficult in practice.

## 6. Conclusions (362)

- The internal market has been at the heart of the European integration project from the beginning, but there is no consensus on its fundamental nature, and it has changed over time.
- There are three possible models (host country control, harmonization, home country control):
  - They are based on different philosophies of market integration.
  - They feature consequences for sovereignty, the balance of legislative and judiciary powers, the protection of public policy interests, and democracy.
- No model has prevailed:
  - The original common market model shifted towards a single market model.
  - The single market model proved to be too unstable.
- Regardless of the model, the internal market requires:
  - Rules on free movement of goods.
  - A conferral of legislative power to the EU.
- Art. 114 TFEU:
  - Gives competence to the EU to harmonize in order to achieve or improve the internal market.
  - The power is subject to certain limitations (it can only be used against obstacles to trade, distortions of competition, but can't be used to create free-standing rights that are unrelated to the internal market).
  - The main forms of harmonization are total and partial.
