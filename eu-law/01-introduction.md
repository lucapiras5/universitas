# 1. Introduction

## 1. Introduction (1)

## 2. Development of EU law (2)

- Early days: EU law focused on economic integration (free movement of goods, persons, capital and services, competition law, and control of State aid).
- Over time: the subject matter has been growing.
  - EEC Treaty: made some references to social policies, due to the impact of economic integration on social standards, now the EU has a body of law in that area.
  - Environmental and consumer law: growing concerns about the impact caused by economic integration led to adopting law in those areas too.
  - Health care: is largely regulated by member States (MS), but significantly affected by the integration process.
- **Spillover effect**:
  - **Notion**: integration in one sector requires integration in another, to ensure integration in the first is maximized.
  - **Economic and monetary union**: due to the EMU, MS share a single currency, the EU coordinates their fiscal and economic policies, and after the 2008 economic crisis, MS had to "bail out" other MS for the currency to survive.
- **Tension between the EU and MS**:
  - Two extremes: effective governance of the EU project and respecting State autonomy and diversity at the local level.
  - Pros: tension leads to creative solutions that satisfy both requirements.
  - Cons: limits the EU's ability to respond to crises, national governments dominate EU politics.
- **Integration outside of economic policies**:
  - **Common commercial policy**: on trade with third (non-EU) countries.
  - **EU environment policy**: significant external dimension.
  - **Common Foreign and Security Policy**: includes defense issues.
  - **Justice and home affairs**: traditionally at the heart of national sovereignty, now EU law has increasingly addressed criminal law, immigration and asylum matters.
- **Territorial scope**: the number of MS increased from 6 to 28, 27 after Brexit.
- **Nature of EU law**: ongoing debate on whehter it's still international law or has become sui generis.
- **EU instutional framework**:
  - Developed over the years, for the adoption and enforcement of EU law
  - Contains basic principles that govern its application, and rules that govern the administration.
  - Constitutional and administrative EU law: raises question about the nature of sovereignty of the EU's legal order, and the EU's adherence to basic constitutional principles.
- **Debates about the role of the EU**: within the EU (multi-level governance), outside the EU (with other major international bodies, such as the UN).

## 3. Themes (4)

- **Output legitimacy**: EU proves its value by achieving objectives with wide popular support. E.g., economic growth, job creation.
- **Input legitimacy**: how fair and democratic the decision-making process is.
- **Relationship**: if the EU tries to do more, then more questions are asked about its democratic credentials, especially in responses to crises.

### Input legitimacy (5)

- Safeguards:
  - Doctrine of separation of power.
  - Vertical division of competences between States
  - General principles of EU law: proportionality, rule of law (transparency, legality, legal certainty, legitimate expectations), good administration, information-related rights, procedural rights.
- Human rights:
  - EU Charter of human rights: became binding in 2009.
  - ECHR: accession has been stalled by the Court of Justice.
  - Security objectives: there are tensions between the two, especially in immigration and asylum law.
  - EU citizenship: changed how courts see nationals of a MS who move to another MS.
- **Vertical question**: how much the EU should do.
  - MS: are inevitably conflicted between controlling EU policies and making them more effective.
  - EU criminal law: MS want to benefit from cooperation, but don't want to lose sovereignty in a sensitive field.
  - MS: can ask the Court to review EU action, but judicial review usually doesn't strike down measures.
  - Individuals: it's hard to bring a case directly before the Court, and parliamentary elections may not represent their interests adequately.
- **Horizontal question**: relative priority of economic over non-economic objectives.

### Output legitimacy (6)

- **Output legitimacy**: directly linked to achievements in substantive EU law (economic integration, economic and monetary union, other policy areas such as healthcare and social policy).
- **Court of Justice**: had to create remedies at the domestic level, this can be either seen as judicial activism, or a necessary measure to enforce the application of measures.
- **Resistance to output legitimacy**: implementation of the four freedoms has led to resistance from MS who want to keep certain goods, persons, or capital out of their border.
- **Financial crisis**:
  - Challenged the EU's claim for output legitimacy, the ability to deliver growth and prosperity.
  - Imposed changes to the welfare State (an area of traditional national competence), cutting down pension and welfare benefits, reducing wages and labor standards.
  - Increased the pressure on MS to open up their public services to competition, but there are some exceptions to allow the provision of SSGI's (social services of general interest) not to be interrupted.
- **Tension between economic and non-economic objectives**: in environmental law, EU law is trying to reconcile the two objectives.

## 4. Conclusion (8)

- EU: has fundamentally changed the relationship between States and their citizens, delivered reforms in major policy areas, and improved the daily quality of life for individuals.
