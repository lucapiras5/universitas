# 3. The EU's political institutions

## 3.1. Introduction (40)

- **Representative democracy**: is the foundation of the functioning of the Union.
  - European Parliament: is directly elected.
  - Council: consists of the MS'  ministers.
  - European Council: consists of the MS' heads of State or government.
  - Ministers and heads of State or government are accountable to the Parliament of each MS.
- **Effectiveness**:
  - Contrasts with democracy.
  - Citizens: believe only the decisions of their national government can be democratic, but individual governments can't veto the adoption of EU measures.
  - EU institutions: have evolved to be more democratically accountable, but less efficient.
  - Council: has shifted toward majority voting, to be more efficient.

## 3.2. Concept of representative democracy (41)

- Representative democracy:
  - Simplest level: the public decides who to vote.
  - Real-word complexity: determining who and how to vote, how to address regional concerns (federal States, second parliamentary chamber).

## 3.2.1. Representative democracy and the EU (42)

- Comparison between EU institutions and political institutions of States:
  - Commission: can be compared to the executive and administration.
  - Parliament and Council: bicameral legislature, the Parliament is the lower house and is directly elected, the Council is the upper house and is not directly elected.
  - Council and European Council: some executive powers.
- Key features of the EU's political and legal system:
  - Division of powers: comparable to the division of powers in federal States.
  - Administration of EU law: its implementation is almost entirely left to individual MS.

## 3.3. Commission (44)

## 3.3.1. Introduction (44)

- Significance: most EU measures are adopted by the Commission or are Commission proposals.
- Criticisms: it has a great deal of power, but is not considered to be sufficiently democratically accountable.

## 3.3.2. Composition (44)

- College of Commissioners: includes two particularly important Commissioners, the President, and High Representative for the CFSP.

## 3.3.2.1. Number of members (44)

- Original composition: one member from each MS, and one extra member for the five biggest MS.
- Balance between efficiency and Commissioners: after the EU enlargements, the number of Commissioners would make it inefficient, but reducing the number would reduce its democratic legitimacy.
- Attempts to reduce the number of Commissioners: they all failed, each State still has one Commissioner.

## 3.3.2.2. President (45)

- Duties: lays down the guidelines for the Commission's work, decides on the internal organization to ensure its efficiency, consistency and collegiality, and appoints Vice-Presidents.
- Prime Minister-like role: can reshuffle the Commission, and force a Commissioner to resign, but these powers have never been used historically.
- Significant influence: over the rest of the Commission, which are named after their President.

## 3.3.2.3. High Representative (45)

- Amsterdam Treaty: the post was part of the Council, not the Commission, but there was also was a Commissioner for external relations.
- Lisbon Treaty: the High Representative was recast as a VP in the Commission, but regarding their foreign policy tasks is answerable to the Council.

## 3.3.2.4. Appointment (46)

- Historically: the President and the rest of the Commission were appointed unanimously by all MS.
- Concerns about the Commission's democratic accountability:
  - Parliament: can approve the appointment of the Commission and its President.
  - Terms of office: changed to 5 years to align it with the Parliament's.
- Commission President:
  - Is appointed first.
  - The European Council nominates a candidate based on the results of the Parliament election, the Parliament confirms the nomination by a majority of its members.
  - Similar to how in national elections voting for a certain party affects the choice of the PM.
- Commissioners:
  - Appointed after the President.
  - The MS propose candidates, with the agreement of the European Council, and the Parliament uses a qualified majority vote.
  - Parliament votes on the entire Commission, and can't reject individual Commissioners, but they can threaten a rejection to pressure prospective Commissioners to resign.
- High Representative:
  - Appointed by the European Council by a qualified majority vote, with the agreement of the President, and the vote of the Parliament.

## 3.3.2.5. Control of the Commission (48)

- MS: no-confidence votes by national parliaments force national governments to resign.
- EU Parliament:
  - It can use a censure vote against the whole Commission, but it has stringent requirements, and has never been used.
  - The only time a censure vote was certain to pass the Commissioners decided to resign.
  - Commissioners remain in office even after they are censored or resign, until they are replaced, which could take some time.
- Commission President:
  - Can force individual commissioners to resign, or reshuffle the Commission, but the powers have never been used.
  - In 2012 a Maltese Commissioner facing a public scandal argued that he had been dismissed, but the Courts unconvincingly argued that he chose to resign.
- High Representative: can be dismissed in the same way he is appointed.
- Vacancies in the Commission: the Council consults the Parliament for a candidate, who is appointed by the Commission President.

## 3.3.3. Powers (49)

- Proposals for EU acts: EU legislation and many non-legislative acts must be approved on the basis of a Commission proposal.
- Negotiation of international treaties:
  - Except for monetary issues, the negotiator is decided by the Council on a case-by-case basis.
  - Treaties must be approved by the Council and the Parliament, the Council grants the Commission the authority to negotiate.
- International representation of the Union: except for foreign policy.
- Adoption of delegated acts and implementing measures:
  - Sub-legislative acts which set out further details of EU policy.
  - Comparable to the powers delegated to the executive in MS to adopt acts to implement legislation, but it's primarily up to MS to implement EU law.
- Administration of the EU's budget:
  - The Council and Parliament decide on the multi-annual budget framework and the amounts of each annual budget.
  - The Parliament supervises the budgetary management.
- Application of EU law in specific cases:
  - Competition law
  - Most areas of EU law are implemented entirely by MS.
- Foreign policy:
  - Conducted by the High Representative, who also coordinates the Commission's overall external activity.

## 3.3.4. Functioning (51)

- Complete independence:
  - Other EU institutions: can't impose orders, but they don't have to follow Commission proposals either.
  - High Representative: is an exception, is accountable to the Council only as far as foreign policy is concerned.
- Decisions: taken by majority, in accordance with the Commission's rules of procedure.
- Administrative tasks:
  - Directorates-General: are the internal divisions of the Commission, each is responsible for a particular subject, and presided by a Commissioner.
  - Inter-service consultations: between different Directorates-Generals, to avoid conflicts.

## 3.4. European Parliament (51)

## 3.4.1. Introduction (51)

- Similarity to national parliaments: it's elected by popular vote at regular intervals, it participates in the legislative process, and holds the executive accountable.

## 3.4.2. Composition (52)

## 3.4.2.1. Number of members (52)

- Number of members: as the EU enlarged, the number of seats has increased to match, and the current maximum number is 751 MEPs.
- Allocation of seats:
  - On the basis of "degressive proportionality", so that smaller States have more weight, relative to their population, than bigger States.
  - The allocation of seats is decided by the European Council.

## 3.4.2.2. Elections (53)

- Term:
  - The Parliament is elected for 5-years terms.
  - The term is fixed, and the Parliament is not dissolved early after a no-confidence vote against the Commission.
- Election to the European Parliament:
  - Proportional representation: seats are allocated according to the percentage of the vote each political party got, instead of the "first-past-the-post" system.
  - Election date: the normal period is in early June, but it can be altered up to two months earlier or one month later.
- Incompatibilities: a MEP can't hold posts in other EU institutions and certain EU bodies, hold a national government post, or be a member of the national parliament.
- Eligibility to vote and stand for election:
  - National law: defines the requirements in compliance with EU law, which specifies that EU citizens who live in another State can vote and run for election in that State, on the same conditions as other nationals of that State.
  - Third country nationals: can be allowed to vote in the European Parliament elections.
  - ECHR: if a sufficient amount of EU law applies in quasi-colonies, their residents must be allowed to vote.

## 3.4.3. Powers (54)

- **Legislative and budgetary functions**:
  - **Ordinary legislative procedure**: it's exercised jointly with the Council.
  - **Special legislative procedures**: they're a number of residual cases, most of them require consultation of the Parliament, and in a few the Parliament has a veto power.
- **Political control**:
  - **Commission**: it controls the appointment of the Commissioners, its President, and its delegated acts.
  - **Other decisions**: they require consent (enlargement and withdrawal, enhanced cooperation, sanctions against MS, conclusion of international agreements, etc.).
- **Consultation**: it applies to innominate non-legislative procedures.
- **Powers beyond the letter of the law**:
  - EU provisions packages: if closely-related EU measures have to be taken using the OLP, the SLP, and non-legislative measures, the Parliament will try to influence the other provisions by threatening a veto on the measures to be taken using the OLP.
  - International Treaties: the Parliament can veto the final conclusion of the Treaty.
  - Freezing of EU funds: to put pressure on other institutions.
  - Court action: it will try to argue that measures should've been taken on the basis of a clause in the Treaty which would give the Parliament more powers, or that non-legislative measures should've been adopted as legislative measures.

## 3.4.4. Functioning (57)

- **Link between Parliament and Commission**:
  - Much weaker than in national governments, because the removal of the Commission won't result in early elections.
  - There is no majority party and opposition parties, and the various "political groups" are made up of members of similar national parties.
  - The Commission has a near-monopoly on legislative initiative, and MEPs can't propose legislative measures.
- **Committees**: they carry out the day-to-day work, they're based on the Commissioners and Directorates-General.
- **Rapporteurs**:
  - They are named in the relevant committee, they draft the Parliament's position on measures, and are responsible for the negotiations with the Council.
  - They take into account the other political groups' opinion to obtain the support of the majority.

## 3.5. Council (58)

## 3.5.1. Introduction (58)

- Council: is the main decision-making organ, shares the role with the European Parliament, is dominated by the MS' governments.
- European Council: it's distinct from the Council, and it's made up of the MS' Presidents and PMs.
- "Upper chamber": since membership is directly linked to the division in States, but it also has executive functions.
- Democratic legitimacy: it entirely depends on the individual ministers' democratic accountability.

## 3.5.2. Composition (58)

- Governments of each MS: decide who will appear in the Council to represent the Government.
- Configurations: the Council doesn't have a fixed membership, but it depends on the subject matter being discussed.
- Configurations found in the TEU:
  - General Affairs Council: usually made up of the MS' European affairs ministers, it handles the multi-annual financial framework, enlargement, and any dossier entrusted to it by the European Council.
  - Foreign Affairs Council: usually made up of the MS' foreign ministers.
- European Council: can adopt a list of additional configurations.

## 3.5.3. Powers (59)

- **Legislative and budgetary functions**:
  - It's exercised jointly with the Parliament.
  - In the **OLP**, they have equal powers, but in the **SLP**, the Council only has to consult the Parliament.
- **Policy-making and coordination functions**:
  - **Innominate non-legislative acts**: the Treaty provides the Council with the authority to adopt acts of a non-legislative nature, in areas such as competition, State aid, or foreign policy measures.
  - **International Treaties**: it can give the Commission a mandate to negotiate, decide the contents of the mandate,oversee the negotiations, decide to sign and conclude the Treaty, suspend the Treaty, and define the EU's position on implementing them.
  - **Open method of coordination**: in the areas of economic, employment and social policies, which results in measures which are called "soft law".

## 3.5.4. Functioning (60)

## 3.5.4.1. Voting in the Council (60)

- Qualified majority voting:
  - It's the default rule, and is used in the OLP.
  - In a minority of cases a simple majority of votes can adopt a measures.
- Unanimous voting:
  - It's used for more sensitive issues, and the SLP.
  - Abstentions don't count against unanimity.
- Workarounds for outvoted MS:
  - Argue that the measure was taken on the wrong legal basis, and unanimous vote should've been used.
  - Use "enhanced cooperation" so that only the group of MS in favor can adopt the measure.
- Principle of degressive proportionality: small MS are given more weight proportional to their population.
- Blocking minority:
  - With every enlargement, the combination of States with enough votes to block a proposal was adjusted.
  - As of 2014, a dual majority requirement applies (15 States out of 27, representing 65% of the EU's population), while a blocking minority requires at least 4 States.
  - In a few sensitive cases, MS with profound objections against a decision can stop its adoption using the "emergency brake" procedure.

## 3.5.4.2. Council Presidencies (63)

- Foreign Affairs Council: is chaired by the High Representative.
- Other configurations: the Presidency is held by a group of three MS, chosen on the basis of their diversity and geographical balance, and each State holds the presidency for 6 months, while the others assist it.
- President's functions:
  - The President schedules and chairs the meetings of the Council, its preparatory bodies, committees and working parties.
  - It will select certain outstanding disputes over policy or legislation that it intends to solve, between MS or between the Council and the Parliament.
  - The European Council can impose a certain agenda or deadlines on the Council President.

## 3.5.4.3. Other aspects (66)

- **Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper)**:
  - They're ambassadors from the MS to the Council, and assist it in all EU measures.
  - It meets in two forms, one dealing with "high politics" (General Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Home Affairs, Economic and Financial Affairs), one dealing with "low politics" (the other configurations).
  - It can't take legally binding decisions, but it can take purely procedural decisions.
- **Working groups and committees**:
  - They prepare the Council's work, and can't take legally binding decisions.
  - Politically sensitive decisions are usually taken by Coreper.
- **Permanent staff**:
  - It's divided into Directorates-General, just like the commission, and presided over by a Secretary-General.

## 3.6. European Council (67)

## 3.6.1. Introduction (67)

- European Council: consists of the heads of State or Government of each MS (while the Council is comprised of national ministers).
- Democratic mandate: conferred by the voters or Parliament of each MS.

## 3.6.2. Composition (67)

- Membership: doesn't include heads of State if their functions are ceremonial, it only includes the PMs or their equivalents.
- Additional members: the High Representative, the President of the European Council, and the President of the Commission can also take part in it, but they can't vote.
- President:
  - Appointment: by the European Council, for two-and-a-half years, renewable once, by a qualified majority vote.
  - Limited powers: the president can't vote, veto legislation, issue instructions to other EU institutions, adopt binding measures, but only organizes the work of the European Council, reports to the Parliament, and represents the EU.
  - Political involvement: it's not just a ceremonial role, and the Presidents have been politically involved.

## 3.6.3. Powers (69)

## 3.6.3.1. Historical background (69)

- Informal basis: it wasn't based on a Treaty or other legally binding texts, but it became the main venue to discuss the main issues facing the EU.
- SEA: simply provided for the existence of the European Council, in the form of heads of State and government.
- Maastricht Treaty: European Council defines the political guidelines for the EU, and submits reports to the Parliament.

## 3.6.3.2. Treaty of Lisbon (70)

- **Official EU Institution**: the European Council can sue and be sued, and has its own rules of procedure.
- **Formal decisions**: it can take decisions on major appointments (Commission President, Commissioners, High Representative), its own functioning and the functioning of other institutions, the Treaty amendment process, decide on sanctions against MS, adopting strategic foreign policy decisions, etc.
- **Giving general guidance**: as opposed to binding decisions, both generally and in specific policy fields (foreign policy, justice and home affairs, dispute settlement in sensitive areas, enlargement, problematic Treaty ratifications).
- **No legislative functions**: the legislative process only involves the Commission, Parliament and Council, but the European Commission can influence legislation (with deadlines or broad guidelines).
- **Practical significance of the European Council**:
  - Enlargement process: decides on eligibility criteria and when to open negotiations.
  - Major Treaty amendments and EU budget process: settles the most difficult issues.
  - Financial crisis: effect upon EMU.
- **Increased efficiency**: with the creation of the office of President.

## 3.6.4. Functioning (72)

- **General rule**: the European Council acts by "consensus", which is not precisely defined, unless the Treaties provide otherwise, and the Treaties often provide otherwise.

## 3.7. Transparency of the EU's political institutions (72)

- **Concerns about transparency**: are intertwined with the concern about the democratic credentials of the EU.
- **Legislative activity**: the Council and Parliament must meet in public when legislating, and the documents created by their working groups, committees, and Coreper must be made public.
- **Non-legislative activity**: the efficiency of the decision-making procedure might be affected by making it public.

## 3.8. Conclusion (73)

- European Parliament: it has been elected directly since 1979, but this hasn't changed the perception that the EU is undemocratic.
- Council: it has a direct connection to national democratic politics, but the fact that national governments may be outvoted makes it seem undemocratic.
- Trade-off between efficiency and democratic accountability: the EU's interests will take priority over the views of democratically elected governments.
- Commission: the EU chose to priority legitimacy over efficiency.
- UK: despite the institutional changes, it still decided to leave the EU.
