# 7. EU law: is it international law? (191)

## 7.1. Introduction (191)

## 7.2.1. EU as an international organization (192)

The European Communities, and then the European Union, were established with international law treaties, and today still, the TEU and TFEU form the basic documents of the EU legal order.

EU is still part of international law, but it has evolved into "something else", and its exact definition is putting pressure on the established categories of legal science.

## 7.2. EU law as a sub-system of international law (192)

The EU is not yet a federal State, but it's also no longer an international organization, it is in a category of its own.

The fundamental reasons for seeing EU as part of international law is because:

- It was founded with, and continues to rely on, international treaties.
- International law is extremely flexible, and allows any kind of cooperation that the States want to agree to, including treaties.

Even though the EU has been a special kind of international organization, its origin in international law remains.

## 7.2.2. International origins of the European integration process (193)

Between 1948 and 1951, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC, later renamed OECD), the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) were created, and aspired towards greater European unity.

Some groups of European federalists had hoped to create a United Europe based on a federal constitution inspired by that of the US, but the European governments chose to use international treaties.

While the OEEC and CoE were set up as traditional organizations where their organs were under the control of national governments, the ECSC required that sovereign States should transfer their powers to regulate the coal and steel industries to a common body, the High Authority.

The term "supranational" was used to describe the defining characteristic of the High Authority and entire Community.

Its institutions had the power to adopt binding acts, some of those decisions were directly applicable to private individuals and firms, and compliance was subject to judicial enforcement.

When the EEC was created in 1957, as a further stage of the integration process, it was given an institutional regime as supranational as that of the ECSC, but with a wider scope covering economic areas, and not just the coal and steel industries.

## 7.2.3. The later evolution of the EC and the EU (194)

The Maastricht Treaty (1992) created the European Union alongside the European Communities, to host two new forms of interstate cooperation, the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the justice and home affairs (JHA), which were marked by a lesser degree of supranationalism.

With the Lisbon Treaty, there are two separate and legally equivalent Treaties (the TEU and TFEU), but a single organization, the European Union, which is still firmly rooted in international law.

The EC and EU remain institutions of international law, and M.S. have accepted this qualification when operating in the international community, and many provisions in the Treaty use generic terms like "international organization" where it is clear than they're talking about the EC or EU.

The EU is considered an international organization by the constitutional law of many Member States, and save for a few countries that expressly recognize the EU, other countries continue to adopt the approach of a generic transfer of powers or limitations of sovereignty for the benefit of international organizations.

The Court of Justice has the authority to declare the legal nature of the EU, and it has called it "its own legal system", but that in itself is not special, since all international organizations have their own legal system based on their founding treaty.

It used the wording "a new legal order of international law" in Van Gend en Loos, but then changed it to "new legal order" in Costa, as if to imply that the new order was no longer attached to international law, but in the following years it didn't seek to establish the non-international nature of EU law.

The Court doesn't need to either, in order to affirm and protect the advanced features of EU law, since international cooperation is extremely flexible.

The deepening of the European integration process mainly took place by revising existing treaties.

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that parties are free to decide how to amend their treaty in the future, in the way they wish, and the rules on amending EU Treaties require the agreement of all the parties, the involvement of the EU institutions in the preparatory phase, and the separate approval of the amendments by each M.S. according to its constitutional requirements.

While the M.S. acted as "Masters of the Treaties", the dynamic evolution of EU law between Treaty revisions escaped their control, and they could correct unwanted evolutions only with the next Treaty revision.

The Lisbon treaty has reduced the amount of control M.S. have over treaty revisions:

- The Convention method introduces the Convention, which represents the national parliaments and EU institutions, but it has only limited powers (it can express opinions or make proposals).
- The simplified procedures allow for the text of the treaties to be amended, by a unilateral decision of an organ of the EU itself.

However, these innovations do not change the fact that M.S. continue to be the "Masters", and that EU law is still anchored in international law, and the fate of the Union remains in the hands of the States that have created it.

## 7.3. The specific features of EU law (199)

Many EU law scholars have argued that he characteristics of Community (now Union) law are so peculiar and far removed from the normal international relations that it doesn't make sense to consider it part of international law.

The legal features of EU law that could support this view are:

- The broad and flexible nature of EU competences.
- The existence of a partially common currency and a common (but derivative) citizenship.
- The decision-making regime, marked by the involvement of institutions not controlled by M.S.
- The mechanism of State compliance.
- The habit of obedience of national courts to their duty to apply EU law.

## 7.3.1. The incomparability of the EU's legal features (200)

Advanced international organizations display several of the characteristic features of the EU, but those decisions rarely deal with sensitive policy matters, and tend to be about technical issues.

In the EU, there is a **constant stream of new legislation in a broad range of policy areas**, typically adopted with the "ordinary legislative procedure".

Regarding judicial enforcement of the law, there are examples of organizations equipped with international courts that have compulsory jurisdiction, and can settle disputes between States, but **it is rare that international courts allow direct access by individual plaintiffs**.

The **European Commission** has the power to sue the Member States before the Court of Justice for infringement of EU law obligations, and **the international rule allowing States to retaliate in the event of non-compliance by other parties did not apply in the context of EU law**.

The **preliminary reference mechanism** has produced in the EU legal system the obligation for national courts to recognize the **primacy of EU law**.

## 7.3.2. The primacy of EU law, a federal characteristic? (201)

- Primacy is the most remote feature of Union law from international law.
- While international treaties generate obligations for States, they are free to decide between direct reception and transformation into national law by way of a statute.
- Treaties can provide specific guidance on how they should integrated into the national law system, but the EU Treaties don't provide this kind of guidance.
- The Court stated that some of their provisions have direct effect, and those norms with direct effect should also enjoy primacy over conflicting national law.

The primacy of EU law is different from the primacy of federal law found in federal States like Germany, Switzerland, the US or Canada:

- There is no right of appeal to the Court of Justice against the judgements of national courts that fail to recognize the primacy of EU law.
- The ultimate hierarchy of norms is not settled in favor of EU law.

In the end, the direct effect and primacy doctrines aren't a shift away from international law, but can be seen as a development thereof, because States are bound by Treaty obligations, and whenever a conflict between Treaty obligations and a norm of national law is brought before the Court of Justice, the Treaty obligation prevails.

## 7.3.3. Finding a name to describe the EU's specificity (204)

There are two options to describe the EU:

- As an international organization unlike any other that has existed before, and other international organizations could adopt some of all of its distinctive features.
- As a entity that went beyond the international legal order, and will probably remain unique.

There is a strong urge to find new names and concepts to describe the nature of the EU:

- Calling it a "sui generis" organization isn't enough.
- "Supranational organization" has fallen in disuse because of its hierarchical overtones, and because it failed to represent the intergovernmental mode of integration.
- "Confederation" isn't used because historical examples of confederations were weak.
- Other terms include a "federation of States", a "commonwealth", or a "constitutional order of States".

Understanding the nature of the EU is useful for legal science, which has been traditionally based on the distinction between "State law" and "non-State law" (legal norms developed outside State structures) and between national law and international law.

## 7.3.4. The constitutional perspective on EU law (206)

Scholars and the Court of Justice argue that EU law forms a "constitutional order", and only some scholars disagree on the ground that constitutions are the basic legal instruments of sovereign States, and not international organizations.

The political attempt to create a Treaty that would establish a Constitution for Europe failed because of its overambitious design, since it sought to replace the existing Treaties.

However, the Treaties perform many of the same functions as national constitutions, since they establish public authority, a division of competences between the EU and M.S., the basic values of the EU legal order, the fundamental rights of persons, and the review of validity of EU action.

## 7.4. The EU as an object and subject of international law (207)

The EU is also a subject of international law, and is entitled to make new international law, which is a feature other international organizations have as well.

The EU can contribute to the development of international law:

- Through its unilateral practice.
- Through concluding Treaties with non-EU States or international organizations.
- Through its activity as a member of multilateral organizations, such as the WTO.

The EU has **replaced the M.S. as an international actor** in those areas within its **exclusive competence**, while in **other areas they share** their Treaty-making competence.

When the EU concludes an international agreement, then international law starts acting as a constraint in the EU.

The EU is increasingly seeking to insert clauses into international agreements that guarantee the primacy of EU law over the obligations in the agreement (so-called **reverse primacy**), so that **on matters already covered by EU law, the convention's provisions will only apply to non-EU signatories**.

The primacy of international agreements recognized in art. 216(2) TFEU relates to **secondary** EU law, but the application of international agreements will be denied if they conflict with the Treaties themselves or with the unwritten principles of primary EU law.

The Court stated that the EU legal order is **autonomous** with regards to the **surrounding international legal environment**, which could be interpreted in two ways:

- As the capacity to adopt special rules that deviate from the general rules of international law, which is unproblematic.
- As the capacity to **prioritize its own internal rules in the case of conflict with external international law obligations**.

In **Kadi**, the Court of Justice refused the application of "external" international law obligations that conflicted with its own internal rules, and stated that international law obligations can never prevail over the highest norms of the EU legal order, in the same way national constitutional courts resolve the conflict between international law and national constitutional law.

## 7.5. Conclusion (210)

The EU can be seen as a developed international organization, with some of the characteristics of a federation.

The revision Treaties show that M.S. governments aren't willing to change the nature of the EU, and experimented in the Lisbon Treaty with the toolkit of international Treaty law.

The choice of a given qualification has hardly any consequences, and qualifying EU law as international law doesn't mean that the limitations of sovereignty should be constructed narrowly.

The recognition of EU law as an advanced form of international law can explain some of its features, without hindering its development, and it makes the "European way of law" a source of inspiration for other States.
