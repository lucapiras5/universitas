# 10. Judicial protection before the Court of Justice of the European Union

## 1. Introduction (283)

- **Court of Justice**:
  - Judicial organ of the Union, entrusted with upholding the rule of law.
  - Reviews the legality of acts and omissions of MS and EU institutions.
  - Interprets EU law at the request of national courts.
- **Three tiers (art. 19(1) TEU)**:
  - **Court of Justice**: previously known as the European Court of Justice.
  - **General Court**: previously known as the Court of First Instance.
  - **Specialized courts**: only the Civil Service Tribunal was created in 2004, to deal with disputes between the Union and members of its staff, but was dismantled and the cases were assigned to the General Court.
- **Two main sets of proceedings**:
  - **Direct action**: brought before the Court of Justice or General Court, dealt with in their entirety before those courts.
  - **Preliminary references**: proceedings begin before a national court, which encounters a question on the interpretation or validity of EU law, and can (sometimes must) make a preliminary reference, and the Court will deliver a preliminary ruling.

## 2. Structure and jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union at a glance (284)

**Court of Justice**:

- Judges: 27, one per MS.
- Advocates General: 11, deliver impartial and independent Opinions in cases that raise new point of law, opinions aren't legally binding but are still influential.

**Configurations of the Court of Justice**:

- Usually: 3 or 5 judges.
- Grand Chamber: 15 judges, if a MS or Institution requests it or if the case is important or difficult.
- Full Court: cases provided by the Treaties, cases of exceptional importance.

**General Court**:

- Judges:
  - At least one judge per MS.
  - To deal with the workload, in 2019 the Statute was amended to double the number of judges.
- Advocates General:
  - None attached.
  - Members of the General Court can be called upon to perform the role, but this happened rarely.
- Configurations: usually sits in chambers of 3 or 5 judges, but can be a Grand Chamber, a Full Court, or a single judge.

**Direct actions**:

- **Infringement or enforcement procedures**: brought by the Commission or a MS **against a MS** that has failed to comply with its obligations under EU law.
- **Action for annulment, for failure to act**: challenge illegal acts and omissions of the **EU institutions**.
- **Action for damages**: obtain compensation for damages or loss suffered as a consequence of an unlawful **Union act**.

**Preliminary references**: on the interpretation and validity of EU law.

**Relationship between direct actions and preliminary references**:

- **Direct actions**: the Court adjudicates on the dispute.
- **Preliminary reference**: the Court gives advice, the dispute is resolved by the national court.
- **Integrated whole**: e.g., between the action for annulment, the plea of illegality, and preliminary rulings on validity.

**Jurisdiction**:

- **Most matters covered by EU law**: **full jurisdiction**.
- Art. 276 TFEU: imposes some restrictions in the areas of freedom, security and justice.
- **CFSP**: no jurisdiction, with the exceptions in art. 275 TFEU.
- **Acts of the European Council or Council**: some restrictions if the acts determine that a MS has committed a serious and persistent breach of the fundamental values of the Union in art. 2 TEU (art. 269 TFEU and art. 7 TEU).

**Division of functions between the Court of Justice and the General Court**:

- **General Court**:
  - Has jurisdiction to hear in first instance direct actions brought by private applicants, by MS against the Commission, by MS against certain acts of the Council.
  - Preliminary references in certain areas can be transferred to the General Court, but this hasn't happened yet (art. 256(3) TFEU).
- **Court of Justice**:
  - Infringement proceedings, inter-institutional disputes, actions by MS against EU legislative acts.
  - All preliminary references.
  - Court of Appeal on points of law from decisions of the General Court.

## 3. Direct actions (289)

- Infringement proceedings, the action for annulment, the action for failure to act and the plea for illegality aim to obtain a declaration that a MS or EU Institution has **breached** EU law.
- The action for damages is a **compensatory action**.

### 3.1. Infringement proceedings (289)

#### Overview (289)

- **Situation**: MS has breached EU law.
- **Applicant**:
  - Commission (art. 258 TFEU)
  - Another MS (art. 259 TFEU, rarely used).
- **Private parties**:
  - Must bring an action before their national court, relying on the direct effect of provisions, or requesting a preliminary reference on the interpretation of EU law.
  - Remedies against the MS' breach of EU law are provided at the national level, in accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and effectiveness.
  - Francovich doctrine: private parties can sue MS for damages before national courts.
- **Administrative phase**:
  - Before the Commission.
  - The MS has an opportunity to remedy the breach or submit observations before starting litigation.
- **Judicial phase**: before the Court of Justice.
  - **Judgement**: is binding if it finds that the MS has failed to fulfil its obligations is binding.
  - **Pecuniary sanctions**: can be imposed with a subsequent action (art. 260 TFEU) after the MS doesn't comply.

#### Elements in art. 258 TFEU (290)

- Commission: can start the proceedings if it considers that a **Member State** has **failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaty**.
- Expansive notion of State:
  - Includes the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State.
  - Also includes any other public bodies, localities, autonomous communities, and private entities controlled by the State.
  - In general, any case in which the infringement of EU law is substantially attributable to the State.
- Defendant: it's always the State, regardless of the entity responsible for the breach.
- Failure to fulfil a treaty obligation include:
  - Both positive acts and omissions.
  - Not only obligations imposed by the Treaties, but also obligations imposed by secondary legislation, international agreements, the general principles of law.
  - E.g., national legislation or administrative practices that are contrary to EU law.
  - E.g., in the Commission v. France "Strawberries" case, the omission of the French government to take any action against the disruption to free movement of goods by private parties (destruction of agricultural produce) was considered a failure to fulfil the obligations in art. 34 TFEU and art. 4(3) TEU.

#### Procedure (291)

- **Commission enjoys wide discretion**:
  - It acts in the **public interest** of the EU, and can choose when to initiate the administrative and judicial phases.
  - **Priorities are ranked** when deciding to pursue infringements of EU law, it will not take up many of the complaints that it receives.
  - There have been **initiatives to increase transparency and accountability**, but the discretion of the Commission remains uncontested.
- **Administrative or pre-litigation phase**:
  - **Letter of formal notice**: first formal step, the Commission defines the subject matter of the dispute, and provides the basis for the MS to submit observations, within a reasonable period.
  - **Reasoned opinion**: follows the submission of observations by the MS, describes the infringement of EU law, the MS is given a reasonable time limit to comply with the opinion, it can't change the subject matter or enlarge the scope of the original complaint.
  - **Failure to comply with the opinion**: the Commission can decide whether to start the judicial phase.
- **Judicial phase**:
  - **Subject matter**: must be the same or narrower than the reasoned opinion's.
  - **Interim measures**: may be granted during the course of the judicial proceedings.
  - **Defences by MS**: the MS have developed a variety of defences, but outside of few exceptions (e.g. force majeure) the Court will reject them (e.g., internal or practical difficulties, Union Institutions have breached EU law, unlawful legislation was obsolete and no longer applied).

#### Sanctions (292)

- **Maastricht Treaty**:
  - Enabled the Court to impose sanctions on MS that failed to comply with the judgement of the Court under arts. 258 and 259 TFEU.
  - Required another administrative and judicial phase, and an application by the Commission to request the imposition of a penalty or a lump sum.
- **Lisbon Treaty**:
  - art. 260 TFEU: was amended to expedite the application of pecuniary sanctions.
  - **Pre-litigation procedure**: if MS don't comply with the judgement of the Court, the Commission **only needs to issue a letter of formal notice**, without a second reasoned opinion.
  - **Determination of penalties**: takes into account the seriousness of the infringement, its duration, the deterrent effect of a sanction, the MS' ability to pay.
  - **Failure to transpose a directive**: the Commission can suggest the penalty that the Court should apply to the defaulting MS in the first set of proceedings, without the need for a second, given the clear and generally indefensible violation of EU law.

### 3.2. Action for annulment (293)

#### Overview (293)

- Action for annulment and for a failure to act
- Four main points:
  - Admissibility
  - Substantive challenge

#### Time limit (294)

- time limit: short, begins to run
- Admissibility:

#### Reviewable acts (294)

- Act should be legally binding:
  - Post-Lisbon classification
  - Non-formalistic approach
  - IBM v Commission:
- Act should come from a EU institution subject to review:
  -
  - Exceptions

#### Standing (295)

- Classification of applicants

##### Privileged and semi-privileged applicants (296)

- Privileged applicants:
  -
  - Parliament:
- Semi-privileged:
  -
  -

##### Non-privileged applicants (296)

- Natural and legal persons
- Situations where they have locus standi:
  - Automatic standing: addressees
  - General standing test: directly and individually concerned
  - Special standing test:
- Addressees:
- Non-addressees:
  - Definitions
  - Balance

##### General standing test: acts of direct and individual concern to the applicant (298)

- Art. 263(4) TFEU:
  - Pre-Lisbon: "decisions"
  - Lisbon: any act that produces legal effects

##### Individual concern (298)

**Plaumann case**:

- Right of interested parties to bring an action: requirements
- Open category:
- Closed category: already defined when the act enters into force

**Exceptions to the closed category test**:

- Special cases, not always consistent
- Codorníu:
- Les Verts v European Parliament:
- Competition law: participation in the proceedings
- Extramet v Council: substantial adverse economic effect

**Sofrimport case**:

- Cumulative test:
  - Membership of a closed class
  - Existence of a duty on the part of the institution
- Court's response to criticism: preliminary reference
- Uncertainty: calls for reform of the test

**Situations of denial of justice**:

- **AG Jacobs**: reformulation of the test, substantive approach
- **UPA v Council**: absence of implementing measures
- **Jégo-Quéré**: right of action could be implemented only by violating the regulation

##### Direct concern (304)

- Definition: direct causal relationship between the act and the applicant
- Addressee of the measure has discretion in implementing it:
  - Effects: wouldn't be caused by the EU measure
  - Act: requires no implementation, there's no discretion in how to implement it, or the exercise of discretion is purely theoretical

##### Conclusion (305)

- Court: wouldn't broaden the test of individual concern
- Lisbon Treaty: introduced a new standing test

##### Lisbon test (305)

- Art. 263(4) TFEU: non-privileged applicant, not an addressee of a contested measure, can challenge a "regulatory act", of "direct concern" to the applicant, that doesn't require "implementing measures"
- Individual concern: doesn't need to be proved
- Issues: definitions of those terms

##### What constitutes a regulatory act (305)

- Regulatory act: general application, non-legislative
- Non-legislative acts:
- Legislative acts: general standing test
- General application: not individual

##### What is a regulatory act of "direct concern" to an applicant (306)

- Direct concern: same meaning in the context of the general standing test

##### What does it meant that the regulatory act must not entail implementing measures (307)

- Further implementation:
  - National level
  - EU level
- Distinct from direct concern:
  - Example:
- Formalistic interpretation:
  - Absence of any measure
  - Consistent with rationale: preliminary ruling on validity
  - Great proportion of EU measures require some action

##### Conclusion (308)

- UPA-style situation: unable to pursue their claim before a national court, and satisfy the general test of standing
- Devolutionist approach

##### Standing of associations and interest groups (309)

- Associations and interest groups: limited standing
- Federolio case:
  - Situations where actions are admissible
- Greenpeace case:
- Post-Lisbon

#### Grounds for annulment and effects of a successful action for annulment (311)

- Suitable ground to challenge the legality
- Lack of competence:
- Infringement of an essential procedural requirement:
- Infringement of the Treaty or any rule of law relating to its application:
- Misuse of powers:
- Effects of the declaration of annulment:

### 3.3. Action for failure to act (312)

- Complement to action for annulment
- Pre-litigation procedure: institution must be asked to act
- Time limit: 2 months, from the end of the pre-litigation procedure
- Legally binding act:
- Privileged applicants:
- Non-privileged applicants:
  - Restrictions
  - Lisbon test:
  - Same requirements in practice:

### 3.4. Plea of illegality (313)

- Incidental mechanism of review, attached to main action
- Illegality of general EU act that constitutes the basis of the acct the annulment of which is sought in the main action pending before the Court
- Limitations:
  - Against an act of general application
  - Dependent on the existence of another action
- Historical usage:
- Grounds for annulment:

### 3.5. Action for damages (314)

- Situation:
- Nature: not a declaration action
- Parties that can bring it:
- Standing conditions: not required
- Time limit:
- Conditions for liability (Lütticke case):
  - Unlawful act or conduct
  - Damage: actual
  - Causal link
- Formalistic approach (Aktien-Zuckerfabrik Schöppenstedt v Council case):
  - Legislative acts
  - Individual acts
- Substantive approach (Bergaderm):
  - Requirements of liability from an unlawful EU act: aligned with requirements of liability from
  - Substantive criterion
  - Coherence and equality between EU institutions and MS
- Ledra Advertising:
  - Facts of the case:
  - Commission and ECB: were acting outside the scope of EU law, they committed the European Stability Mechanism alone
  - Court: still had jurisdiction, Commission had a duty to ensure the ESM measures were consistent with the principles of EU law
  - Conclusion:

## 4. Preliminary references (316)

- Proceedings: start before the national court
- National court: makes a reference to the Court of Justice on the interpretation or validity of EU law that is relevant to the case
- Court of Justice:
  - Delivers a preliminary ruling, is applied to the facts of the case by the national courts
  - Non-contentious procedure: the parties in the main action ...
- Relationship of cooperation: not hierarchical, but a separation of tasks
- Art. 267 TFEU: uniform application of EU law by the national courts

### 4.1. Court or tribunal of a MS (317)

- Initiative to request a preliminary reference: belongs exclusively to national courts or tribunals
- Definition: not in the Treaties, but through case law
- Cumulative factors:
- Additional requirements

### 4.2. Types of preliminary reference (318)

**Preliminary references on the interpretation of EU law**:

- Treaty provisions, general principles of law, acts of the Institutions, bodies and agencies
- Legally-binding acts (regulations, directives, decisions), non-legally-binding acts (recommendations and opinions), judgements of the court
- Court of Justice:
  - Can't decide on the validity of national law
  - In practice the application of most preliminary rulings leaves national courts with no choice, but to declare national measures incompatible with EU law

**Preliminary references on validity**:

- **Foto-Frost case**: national courts can only confirm the validity of EU law, only the Court of Justice can declare an EU act invalid
- **Mandatory**: if the national court has doubts about the legality of a Union measure

#### Relationship between annulment proceedings and preliminary references on validity (319)

- Alternative to the standing test in art. 263 TFEU
- Doesn't always guarantee a remedy:
  - Absence of national implementing measures
  - Applicants would have to break the law
  - National law requirements make it excessively difficult or impossible to challenge national measures implementing EU law
- Solutions:
  - Legislative measure that don't require implementation are rare, but it's an unsolved issue
  - Inuit I case: the burden to ensure there is an avenue to make a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice is on the national legal system (art. 19(1) TEU)
- Evasion of time limits:
  - Applicant would've had standing to bring an action under art. 263 TFEU, but didn't, can't use the reference on validity (TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf case)

### 4.3. Discretion to refer and limits (321)

- Art. 267(2) TFEU: "any" national courts and tribunals "may" make a reference to the Court
- Court of Justice: created limitations to the national court's discretion to deal with the increased workload

**Cases where the Court won't entertain a reference**:

- Lack of a genuine dispute: the exclusive purpose of proceedings is to trigger a reference on a specific point of EU law
- Referred question is irrelevant or hypothetical:
  - Separation of functions
  - Question of jurisdiction
- National court hasn't articulated the questions properly or didn't submit sufficient information on the factual and legal background
  - Art. 94 Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice

### 4.4. Duty to refer and exceptions (323)

- Art. 267(3): obligation to refer, national courts against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy
- Supreme courts, or courts against whose decision there is no remedy in that particular case
- Duty is absolute, two exceptions
- Court has already answered the reference
- Acte clair doctrine:
  - Potential for abuse, stringent requirements
  - Risk of creating a threat against the uniform implementation of EU law
  - Doctrine of State liability in damages:

### 4.5. Effects of a preliminary ruling (324)

- Preliminary ruling on interpretation:
  - Binding on the national referring court
  - Other national courts and public authorities should treat it as authoritative
- Preliminary ruling on validity:
  - Technically only addressed to the referring court, but other national courts can use it to regard the act as void
  - Little difference between a successful action for annulment and a preliminary ruling on validity

## 5. Interim relief (324)

- Direct actions:
  - Arts. 278 and 279 TFEU: negative and positive interim measures in connection with a main action
  - Conditions: prima facie case, urgency (threat of serious and irreparable damage to the applicant)
  - Third step: balance of interests
- Preliminary references on interpretation:
  - Especially if the compatibility of national measures with EU law is at stake
  - Granted according to the rules of national law, as long as they're effective and non-discriminatory
- Preliminary references on validity:
  - Interim relief is not provided in the Treaties, but common principles were developed by the Court of Justice after the Foto-Frost case
  - Positive and negative reliefs
  - Conditions

## 6. Relationship between the Treaty remedies (326)

### Case study 10.1: Inuit litigation (326)

- Regulation 1007/2009:
  - Aim of harmonizing rules across the EU concerning the commercialization of seal products
  - Only allowed products: traditional methods of hunting by Inuit communities, contributed to their subsistence
- Court in Inuit I:
  - Interim relief: rejected for lack of urgency
  - Action for annulment: Lisbon standing test is not applicable, rejected under the general standing test because the applicants were not individually concerned
- Regulation 737/2010:
  - Adopted as an implementing Regulation to Regulation 1007/2009, laid specific rules for the implementation of the parent Regulation
  - Applicants in Inuit I brought a second action against the implementing Regulation, and raised a plea of illegality against the parent Regulation
- Court in Inuit II:
  - ...

### Case study 10.2: Sofrimport litigation (329)

- Significance: a private applicant was successful in annulment proceedings, securing interim measures, and suing the Commission in damages
- Action for annulment:
- Interim relief:
- Action for damages:

### Case study 10.3: Milk quotas and legitimate expectations (330)

- Facts of the case:
  - First regulation:
  - Quotas regulation:
- Two options:
  - Action for annulment:
  - Preliminary reference for validity:
- Action for damages:

## 7. Conclusion (331)

- Remedies to the Court of Justice:
  - Protect against illegal Union action
  - Secure a uniform and consistent interpretation
- Centralized remedies: direct actions, preliminary references
- Decentralized remedies:
  - National courts:
  - Application of EU law, national remedies (principle of equality and effectiveness), apply the doctrine of State liability in damages
- Interactions: between actions, between Courts
- Protection afforded to private parties:
  - Gaps still remain
  - National courts have a shared responsibility
