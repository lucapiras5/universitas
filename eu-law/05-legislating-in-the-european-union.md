# 5. Legislating in the European Union (p. 101)

## 5.1. Introduction (ibid.)

- **Nature of the EU**:
  - The EU is not a State, but it exercises powers which are normally exercised by States, and does so through institutions and procedures which are modelled to a large extent on that of federal States.
  - The EU must balance its freedom of action with that of the States, and the exercise of these competencies is subject to various constraints, and amenable to judicial review by the EUCJ.
  - The granting of new powers to the Union has been followed by rules which try to constrain Union action, but federalism prevails.
  - Institutional balance: disciplines the distribution of powers between Institutions, using due regard for the power of other Institutions.
  - Principle of sincere cooperation: disciplines the exercise of powers by Institutions, within their limits, not their distribution.

## 5.2. Forms of legislative and other normative acts (p. 103)

- Regulations and directives: main forms of normative acts.
- Rule-making decisions and international agreements: legally binding.
- Guidelines and recommendations: have the legal effect attributed to them in their specific context.
- Opinions: neither normative, nor legally binding.
- **Treaty provisions**: can restrict the form and material content of Union action in certain areas.
- **General rule**: Institutions are free to choose the form, in accordance with the principle of proportionality (least intrusive form for a given aim).

## 5.2.1. Regulations (p. 104)

- Characteristics: normative act, binding in its entirety, directly applicable in all MS, comparable to statutes or laws in a national legal order.
- Implementation: MS don't need to adopt national measures, unless required to do so by the regulation itself.
- Scope: generally used for common policies, but there are exceptions.

## 5.2.2. Directives (ibid.)

- **Characteristics**: normative act, addressed to MS.
- **Implementation**: MS must transpose the directive into national law before a certain deadline, and inform the Commission of the transposition measures.
- **Principle of subsidiarity**: the EU only provides the rules and procedures which are strictly necessary, trusting MS to adapt their national laws and procedures accordingly.
- **Scope:**
  - **In theory**: used for areas which are already subject to a developed legal framework in MS.
  - **In practice**: directives tend to regulate policy areas in great detail, leaving MS little discretion, because MS haven't always transposed directives faithfully.
- **Remedies against improper implementation**:
  - **Direct effect**: if the implementation deadline has passed, individuals can rely on unimplemented provisions, if they are unconditional and sufficiently precise.
  - **Judicial procedure**: the Court can impose financial penalties against States that failed to transpose or apply directives properly.

## 5.2.3. "Rule-making decisions" (p. 105)

- **Characteristics**: normative act, binding in its entirety only to whom it is addressed.
- **Scope**: certain policy measures and institutional arrangements.

## 5.2.4. International agreements (p. 106)

- **Characteristics**: incorporated into the EU legal order by a Council decision, following a specific, non-legislative procedure, binding on the Institutions, they can provide a criterion for the validity of EU acts.

## 5.2.5. Interinstitutional agreements (ibid.)

- **Characteristics**: contractual rather than normative nature, some become Treaty obligations.
- **Scope**: agreements on specific matters and delicate political questions.
- **Enforcement**:
  - **Binding agreements**: the Court will annul acts that contravene the agreement.
  - **Non-binding agreements**: Institutions are expected to honor them.

## 5.2.6. Recommendations, opinions and other non-binding acts (p. 107)

- **Characteristics**: recommendations and opinions formally have no binding force, but in practice non-compliance can lead to the adoption of binding measures.
- **Relationship with binding acts**: if the Parliament and Council can adopt legislative acts, they can't adopt non-binding acts.
- **Consultation procedure**: despite the non-binding nature, it's still required, or the act will be annulled.
- **Soft law**: shouldn't be called "law" since it's not binding.
- **Open method of coordination**:
  - Used if the traditional command and control mechanisms are inappropriate, or the subject matter is too sensitive or inappropriate for Union action.
  - It defines guidelines that are implemented with action plans at the national level, the process requires the participation of the local government and civil society in the planning, review and implementation stages.
- **Soft law that creates rights or obligations**: it is subject to judicial review, and can be annulled by the Court.
- **Other normative instruments**:
  - Despite their non-binding nature, or the fact that they're not part of the Union bodies, they can still have legal effects on the Union.
  - E.g., the European Committee for Standardization is a private association, and its standards are adopted on a voluntary basis, but the Court claimed that it can interpret those standards in a preliminary ruling.

## 5.3. Hierarchy of norms (p. 108)

- **Primary law**: includes the Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the fundamental principles of Union law.
- **Secondary law**: includes acts which are based on primary law.
- **Regulatory acts**: adopted by the Commission (and the Council, in limited cases), on the basis of enabling provisions in Treaties or secondary law.
- **Validity of provisions**:
  - Treaties: the Court can't rule on the validity of their provisions, but it can rule on the validity of the procedural and substantive aspects of the amendment procedure.
  - Secondary law: it must comply with primary law.
  - Regulatory acts: it must respect the conditions and limitations of the enabling provision, or it will be annulled for being ultra vires.
- **Conflict between primary law sources**: it's the most problematic case. E.g., a Treaty provision fails to ensure the protection of a fundamental right.

## 5.4. Competences and conferral (p. 109)

## 5.4.1. Competence as ability and competence as power (109)

- **Competence**: it is used in the meaning of "legal authority" or "power" to take a decision.
- **Treaty of Lisbon**: divided the competences of the Union in three categories (exclusive, shared and ancillary).
- **Related principles**: Union competences are determined on the basis of the principles of conferral, subsidiarity and proportionality.

## 5.4.2. Conferral (110)

- **Art. 1 TEU**: MS confer competences to the Union to attain objectives that they have in common.
- **Consequences**:
  - Competences not conferred to the Union remain with the MS.
  - The Union and its Institutions shall only act within the limits of the conferred competencies.
  - The Court can annul acts that violate the principle of conferral.

## 5.4.3. Grants of legislative power (legal bases) (111)

- **Legal basis for binding acts**: every binding act must find a legal foundation in the Treaties or another pre-existing normative act, that determines who can adopt the act, what the act can contain, and the procedure to use.
- **Challenges against legal basis**: disputes on whether the Union has exceeded its competences challenge the choice of a legal basis, because Union competence may be available under a different legal basis, or art. 352 TFEU as a last resort.
- **Relevance of legal basis**:
  - **Explicit indication**: the legal basis must be identified, or identifiable from other parts of the act, otherwise the act will be annulled.
  - **Compliance**: the legal basis must be in force, and its procedural rules must be followed.
- **Challenges against lack of competence**: they are rare.
- **Secondary legal bases**: disallowed practice by the Court, alleviated procedures can't be used.

## 5.4.4. Classification of competences (113)

- **Classification**: competences are divided into categories (exclusive, shared, ancillary) which are further divided into areas.
- **Two stand-alone areas**: they are not included in the categories: the power to adopt arrangements for the coordination of the MS' economic and employment policies, and the competence to define and implement a common foreign and security policy.

## 5.4.4.1. Exclusive competence (113)

- **Notion**: only the Union can adopt legally binding acts.
- **Not absolute**: MS can be authorized to adopt legislation and other measures, if the Union has been unable to exercise its competence and there is the necessity of urgent conservation measures.
- **Exhaustive**: the list is intended to be exhaustive.

## 5.4.4.2. Shared competences (114)

- **Notion**: residual category, for all competences not defined as exclusive or ancillary, the list provides only the principal areas of such competence.
- **Pre-emption**: once the Union adopts rules on a certain subject-matter, the MS may no longer legislate in the specific areas already covered by Union law.
- **Exclusion of pre-emption**: pre-emption is excluded in some areas (research, technological development and space, development cooperation, humanitarian aid).
- **Minimum standards**: in other areas, it's limited to providing minimum standards (mutual recognition of judgements of criminal courts, definition of serious trans-border crimes, social policy).

## 5.4.4.3. Ancillary or complementary competences (115)

- **Notion**: Union action is limited to supporting, coordinating or supplementing the action of MS.
- **Harmonization in ancillary competences**: it's possible to harmonize these competences as well, if the conditions for recourse to the internal market are met.
- **Areas concerned**: they are matters of shared concern between MS, but which are also too close to national interests, identity or are otherwise too politically sensitive to be harmonized by the Union.

## 5.4.4.4. Common foreign security policy (116)

- **Separate treatment**: the decision-making procedures and legal instruments differ significantly from those used in the general regime.
- **Legal instruments**: legislation is excluded in favor of guidelines, decisions defining Union actions, positions, implementing arrangements, systematic cooperation.
- **Court jurisdiction**: against measures that freeze the assets of individuals or associations in implementation of the decisions of the UN SC, or measures that prohibit entry into the territory of the Union to persons considered undesirable for reasons of foreign policy.
- **Relationship with the general regime**:
  - CFSP measures can be challenged on the grounds that they fall under the general regime.
  - The High Representative has a duty to ensure the consistency and avoid contradictions between the CFSP and general regime.

## 5.5. Subsidiarity (117)

- **Subsidiarity**: decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the citizens.
- **Functions**: the principle of subsidiarity determines whether the Union should exercise its competence in a particular area, and as a criterion of the validity of the measures involved in the context of judicial review.
- **General application**: all the Institutions must respect it, and the "early warning" mechanism allows national parliaments to express their views on proposed legislation.

## 5.5.1. Subsidiarity test (117)

- **Exclusive competence areas**: they're exempt from the test.
- **Necessity test**: the objectives of the proposed action can't be achieved by the MS, either at the central level or at the regional or local level.
- **Added value test**: the proposed action would be better achieved at the Union level because of its scale or effects, and the scale or effects can't be too small or only minor.
- **International level**: it's not clear whether the States have to demonstrate that the effects could be better achieved at an international, rather than Union, level, for the added value test.
- **Inherent unfitness**: subsidiarity tends to privilege the achievement of Union objectives unfairly.

## 5.5.2. Early warning mechanism (119)

- **Early warning mechanism**: national parliaments receive drafts of legislative acts, and a detailed statement allowing the parliaments to determine the compliance of the legislative act with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
- **Reasoned opinion**: the national parliaments have an 8-week period to produce a reasoned opinion as to why the draft fails to comply with the subsidiarity principles.
- **Votes**: each parliament has 2 votes at its disposal.

## 5.5.2.1. Opinion of individual parliaments or chambers (119)

- **EU Institutions**: in the absence of any indication to the contrary, they are obliged to "take account of" but not follow the parliament's opinion, or take any further action.

## 5.5.2.2. Collective opinion (119)

- **Minimum threshold**: the negative votes must reach a threshold (18 votes out of 54, or 14 if the initiative falls under the area of freedom, security and justice).
- **Collective opinion**: it is an aggregate of the reasoned opinions of all the national parliamentary bodies, and it requires that the draft legislation must be reviewed.
- **After the review**: the initiator of the draft can maintain, amend or withdraw it, but must provide a reason.

## 5.5.2.3. Special legislative opinion (120)

- **Scope**: the special legislative opinion can be used when the national parliaments are examining a Commission proposal under the OLP.
- **Threshold**: it's a simple majority (27 votes out of 54).
- **After the review**:
  - If the Commission maintains the proposal, it must explain how the proposal complies with the subsidiarity test.
  - The Parliament and Council must take "particular account" of the opinions of the MS and the Commission.
  - The proposal can be stopped if the majority of the MEPs or Council reject it on grounds of subsidiarity compliance.

## 5.5.3. Scope of the early warning mechanism (120)

- **Limitations**:
  - The early warning mechanism only applies to legislation, which excludes innominate non-legislative proposals, which may still have legislative content.
  - It also only applies to the initial proposal by the Commission, which excludes the preparatory acts that will make their appearance later.
- **Justification**: increasing the scope would've created too many practical problems.
- **Limited effectiveness**:
  - Even if the threshold is reached, the only requirement is only to "take account" or "take particular account" of the national parliaments' opinion.
  - It could be argued that the usefulness of the procedure is to inform national parliaments of upcoming legislation, so that they can influence their ministers.

## 5.5.4. Judicial review of compliance with the subsidiarity test (122)

- **Judicial review**: despite its highly political character, the subsidiarity test is intended to be justiciable, but some MS hesitated to rely on a substantive breach of this principle when challenging legislation on which they'd been outvoted.
- **Single test**:
  - The Court finds that "better achievement at the Union level" is decisive, even if individual MS could achieve the same objective.
  - If between two interdependent objectives one can be better achieved at the MS level, that doesn't result in a breach of the principle of subsidiarity, because the principle isn't intended to limit EU competences based on the situation of individual MS, but to grant it if the proposed action can be better achieved at the EU level.
- **Judicial review by national parliaments**:
  - The national parliaments are allowed to challenge acts on the basis of the breach of subsidiarity.
  - Some MS allow a minority in the national parliament to initiate such actions, since a majority would always be able to force the government to bring an annulment action.

## 5.6. Proportionality (123)

- **Proportionality**: the content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty.
- **Impact assessment**:
  - The legislature enjoys a wide discretion, and must base its choices on objective criteria and minimize the burden on economic operators.
  - Impact assessments must be carried out as a rule, but proportionality is not violated if the legislature already has enough information to assess the proportionality of the measure to be adopted.
  - The Court only exercise a marginal review, and will intervene if the action taken is manifestly inappropriate to the objective sought by the measure.
- **Breach of the principle**:
  - The objective of the measure couldn't be pursued under the Treaty, or the same objective could be achieved with less intrusive means.
  - E.g., in *British American Tobacco*, the Court had to rule on the validity of a ban on the manufacture of cigarettes that didn't comply with Union standards, but were made for export to third countries, and it found that the ban was a more efficient means to combat illegal trafficking.
- **Constant respect**:
  - All Institutions must ensure constant respect of the principle of proportionality.
  - However, it doesn't benefit from the early warning mechanism or special provisions on judicial review as the principle of subsidiarity does.

## Case study 5.1. Vodafone

- 2007 Roaming Regulation: it reduced the prices paid by consumers for mobile phone calls made or received in a MS other than their home MS, and was challenged on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality.
- Subsidiarity: initiatives at the MS level would've been liable to disrupt the functioning of the Community-wide internal roaming market, since each MS could've decided on the prices differently, so the objective pursued by the regulation was best achieved at the Community level.
- Proportionality: the decision to place a cap on both wholesale and retail prices was found to be not manifestly inappropriate, also because the other solutions wouldn't have resulted in a reduction of prices.

## 5.7. Legislative and other decision-making procedures (126)

- **Decision-making procedures**: are how the Union exercises its competences, and are detailed by the legal basis of the act, which defines the degree of formal influence each Institutional actor can bring on the outcome.
- **Lisbon Treaty**: it introduced a distinction between "legislation" and other forms of normative acts, and between primary and secondary measures.
- **Legislation**:
  - Any act adopted on the basis of the ordinary legislative procedure, or special legislative procedures.
  - It is necessarily adopted in public, and must define the essential elements of the matter to be dealt with, and this power can't be delegated.
- **Other forms of normative acts**: they're adopted on the basis of Treaty provisions which contain procedures not defined as "legislative", the so-called "innominate non-legislative procedures".
- **Delegated or implementing acts**: they're taken on the basis of enabling provisions contained in secondary law, which was adopted on the basis of legislative and assimilated procedures.

## 5.7.1. Legislative and assimilated procedures (127)

- **Kinds of procedures**: there is the Ordinary and Special Legislative Procedures (OLP, SLP) and the Innominate Non-legislative Procedure (INP), and in practice, the OLP is the most important by far.

## 5.7.1.1. Ordinary legislative procedure (127)

- **Source**: art. 294 TFEU.
- **Initiation**: the procedure can only be initiated after the Commission submits a proposal.
- **Consultations**: the Commission must carry out consultations with the parties concerned, to ensure that Union action is coherent and transparent, in accordance with the democratic principles which govern all of its activities.
- **Invitations**: the Commission may be invited to submit proposals by the Parliament, Council, or by a million citizens from at least a quarter of the MS, and must state its reasons in case it doesn't submit a proposal.
- **Amendments**: the Commission can amend its proposal at any time, until the Council's first reading.
- **First reading**: if the Council doesn't approve the Parliament's position, it communicates its own position to the Parliament.
- **Second reading**:
  - The Parliament can approve (adopt the act) or reject (not adopt the act) the Council's position, or propose amendments, which are evaluated by the Council and Commission.
  - The Council can agree with all the amendments (adopt the act), or convene a meeting of the conciliation committee.
- **Third reading**: 
  - The conciliation committee is composed by members of the Council and Parliament, and decides on a joint text.
  - The Commission takes part in the conciliation procedure, and takes all necessary initiatives to reconcile the views of the Parliament and Council.
  - The act is not adopted if the conciliation committee fails to reach an agreement, or if the Parliament or Council vote against the joint text.
- **Other initiatives**:
  - **Court of Justice**: can propose amendments to its Statute, except for the subject matters which require a Treaty amendment (the status of its members and the Court's language regime).
  - **European Central Bank**: can propose amendments to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, and of the European Central Bank.
  - **Judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation**: must be initiated by a quarter of the MS.
- **Oppositions**:
  - Each of the institutions can prevent the adoption of the act at different stages of the procedure.
  - The Commission can withdraw its proposal, but must provide a reason, which is subject to judicial review.
- **Real-word practice**: most legislative acts are adopted on first reading, after informal negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and Council.

## 5.7.1.2. Emergency brakes (129)

- **Emergency brake**:
  - It can be used in certain policy areas (social security for workers in other MS, certain aspects of criminal justice).
  - The MS considers that the legislation being proposed would affect important or fundamental aspects of its existing national system.
  - The question can be referred to the European Council for a period of reflection.
- **Never used**: to date.

## 5.7.2. Special legislative procedures (130)

- **No single procedure**: but a variety of procedures, which differ as to who initiates it, who can participate, and the voting rules that apply.
- **Derogations cases**:
  - **Sensitive policy areas**: a large majority of SLPs deviate from the OLP in a particular area, to take account of the national sensibilities, especially in the political, budgetary, economic and social fields.
  - **Procedure**: they're initiated by a Commission proposal, the Parliament is consulted, and the Council adopts the act by unanimous vote.
- **Parliament**:
  - **Consent**: in other policy areas. E.g., certain decisions on the Union's budget, and the regulation establishing the multi-annual financial framework.
  - **Initiative and adoption**: on most (not all) matters concerning its own functioning, or within its specific responsibility.
- **Union budget**: adopted under a special legislative procedure.
- **European Investment Bank**: can initiate the procedure to amend its own Statute, which is a right shared with the Commission.

## 5.7.3. Innominate non-legislative procedures (131)

- **INP**: a number of normative measures are taken directly on the basis of the Treaty, with a procedure that is not described as "legislative".
= **Minimal procedural requirements**: measures are adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, with a qualified majority in the Council, and often without any participation, or at most the opinion, of the Parliament.
- **Scope**: they're used for chiefly executive or technical measures, to maintain legacy institutional arrangements, or for certain emergency measures.
- **Relationship between OLP and INP in art 43 TFEU**:
  - Agricultural policy is adopted according to the OLP, but the fixing of agricultural prices is adopted according to an INP.
  - INPs are not implementing acts (cf. art. 291 TFEU), and matters reserved to the Council by an INP can't be appropriated by the Parliament, and vice-versa.

## 5.7.4. Consultation and assimilated requirements (132)

- **Consultation of institutions and ancillary bodies**: may be required by the INP, SLP, or in the first reading of the OLP.
- **Opinion**: its content is not binding, but requesting it is a substantive procedural requirement, the lack of which can be grounds for the annulment of the act, unless the breach was due to the institution being consulted.
- **Consultation of the Parliament**:
  - If a legal basis requires the Council to consult the Parliament, it the latter must be able to effectively participate.
  - The Parliament must be immediately and fully informed of all stages in the procedure for negotiating and concluding international agreements, including those related to the CFSP, so that the Parliament can exercise democratic control over the Union's external action.

## 5.8. Delegated and implementing acts (132)

- **Derived normative measures**:
  - Are based on an enabling provision contained in an act of legislation or adopted under an INP.
  - They're also known as "secondary legislation".

## 5.8.1. Delegated acts (133)

- **Delegated act**:
  - Refers specifically to acts adopted under art. 290 TFEU.
  - In principle, the legislature could've adopted these acts by itself, but it decided to delegate their adoption to the Commission. E.g., complex subject matter, rapidly changing circumstances, etc.

## 5.8.1.1. Common Understanding (133)

- **Delegation**: art. 290 TFEU only requires that the legislature determines in each individual case the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation, and mechanisms that apply to the exercise of delegated powers.
- **Institutions**: the Parliament, Council and Commission adopted the Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and decided on non-binding supplemental criteria on the choice of the secondary normative act.

## 5.8.1.2. Forms of supervision (134)

- **Forms of supervision in art. 290(1) TFEU**: either branch of the legislature can revoke the delegation, or object to the entry into force of individual delegated acts.
- **Other forms of supervision**: the wording in art. 290(2) TFEU is ambiguous as to whether they can be used, according to the Parliament they can, but according to the Common Understanding the institutions are committed to using revocation or objection only.
- **Parliament supervision in SLPs**: art. 290(2) TFEU suggests that the Parliament can supervise "all legislative acts", even if it was adopted by the Council alone on the basis of a SLP.
- **Objection procedure**: the act won't enter into force after the objection period (2 months, can be extended by a further 2 months) has expired.
- **Urgency procedure**: the act can enter into force before the expiration of the objection period, and until the Parliament or Council raise an objection.
- **Consultations**: the Commission must consult experts designated by MS in the preparation of draft delegated acts, and state how they will take their views into consideration, and how they will proceed.

## 5.8.1.3. Limitations on delegation and the identification of delegated acts (135)

- **Difference between delegated and implementing acts**:
  - **Delegated acts**: is one the legislature could've adopted itself, and so it can only be used in legislative measures.
  - **Implementing acts**: can be adopted on the basis of any legally binding Union acts.
- **Powers**:
  - **Supplementing delegated acts**: further detail the legislative measure without changing it.
  - **Amending delegated act**: can modify or repeal non-essential elements of the legislative measure.
  - **Legislative measure**: must state which of the two powers it is conferring on the Commission.
- **Identification**: "delegated acts" must be named as such in their title.

## 5.8.2. Implementing acts (135)

- **Implementing acts**:
  - Allow the Commission (or exceptionally the Council) to provide further detail to a legislative act, to ensure that it's implemented uniformly in all MS.
  - The Commission can't amend or supplement the legislative measure.
 **Judicial review of the choice between delegated and implementing acts**: it's limited to whether the act only needs further detail (without amendments or supplements), and the provisions of basic legislation require uniform condition for implementation.
- **Supervision by States**: the Parliament and Council are excluded from supervising the exercise of these powers.
- **Identification**: "implementing acts" must be named as such in their title.

## 5.8.2.1. Conferral of implementing powers and the Neo-Comitology Regulation (136)

- **Institutions which can confer implementing powers**:
  - The powers can be conferred in "any legally binding Union act", including legislation.
  - Outside the OLP, the power of conferral goes almost exclusively to the Council (which adopts the majority of SLPs and INPs).
  - In duly specified cases, and in the case of CFSP, it must be conferred on the Council.
- **Neo-Comitology Regulation**: provides a mechanism for control by the MS, through the "advisory procedure" and the "examination procedure".

## 5.8.2.2. Common features of the supervisory process (137)

- **Committees**: that participate in the neo-comitology system are composed of representatives of the MS, who are free to choose them.
- **Draft implementing measure**: is presented by the Commission, individual members of the committee can propose amendments, and the Commission is charged with presenting an amended draft that commands the widest possible support.
- **Timetable**: the Commission fixes the timetable for consideration of its draft measures, and can use a procedure for urgent considerations.
- **Voting requirements**: modelled on those of the Council.

## 5.8.2.3. Choice of supervisory procedure (137)

- **Regulation**: provides guidelines on the appropriate supervision procedure for a given subject matter.
- **Examination procedure**: is used for acts of general scope, and certain types of implementing acts which may be sensitive in the MS, such as those impacting the budget, taxation, or the subject matters of exclusive Union competence.
- **Advisory procedure**: is the default procedure, but can be used where the examination procedure should be used, in duly justified cases.

## 5.8.2.4. Advisory procedure (137)

- **Commission**: submits a proposal.
- **Committee**: gives its opinion, by consensus or majority vote.
- **Commission**:
  - Proceeds, taking account of the opinion, which is not binding.
  - The consultation of the committee is a substantial procedural requirement, violation of which can be grounds to annul the act.
  - It's in the Commission's interest to know the views of MS in advance, since they will be carrying out the implementing act.

## 5.8.2.5. Examination procedure (138)

- **Commission**: submits a proposal.
- **Committee adopts an opinion on the proposal**:
  - **Supported by a qualified majority**: it's adopted.
  - **Negative opinion**: the Commission can submit an amended version or refer the matter to the appeal committee.
- **Committee fails to adopt an opinion**: the Commission can adopt the proposal, except in four cases, where it is obliged to either amend the proposal, or refer it to the appeal committee.
- **Adoption required without delay**:
  - The Commission can override the opposition if the measure is required to avoid a disruption of the agricultural markets or the Union's financial interests.
  - The Commission must submit the measure to the appeal committee immediately, and repeal it if the committee adopts a negative opinion.

## 5.8.2.6. Appeal committee (138)

- **Appeal committe**: used if adoption of the draft measure is blocked by the committee.
- **National representatives**: they should be at a higher rank than the representatives found in the advisory or examination procedures.
- **Amendments**: the members can propose amendments to the draft implementing measure, and the Commission must find solution that command the widest possible support.
- **Voting**: the committee acts by a qualified majority, a positive or negative opinion allow or forbid the Commission from adopting the measure, while no opinion means the Commission is free to choose.

## 5.8.2.7. Immediately applicable implementing acts (139)

- **Notion**: the Commission can adopt an implementing measure before it's submitted to the committee for the advisory or examination procedure.
- **Requirements**: there must be justified, imperative grounds of urgency, and the measures are effective for up to 6 months (or the longer duration in the basic act).

## 5.8.2.8. Openness in committee governance (139)

- **Parliament and Council**:
  - **Register of committee proceedings**: is maintained by the Commission, they have access to it.
  - **Right of scrutiny**: they receive at the same time as the committees themselves the meeting agendas, draft implementing acts, the final draft, so they determine whether the implementing act is ultra vires the basic act.
- **Members of the Committees**: they don't have to be published, and such information may be considered protected data.

## 5.8.3. Borderline between delegated and implementing acts (140)

- **Comparison between delegated and implementing acts**:
  - **Delegated act**: defined in terms of its **content**, non-legislative acts of general application that supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act.
  - **Implementing act**: defined in terms of its **rationale**, the necessity to lay down uniform conditions for the implementation of legally-binding Union acts.
- **Opposing interests in Institutions**:
  - **Parliament**: prefers delegated acts, because it is largely excluded from the supervision of implemented acts.
  - **Council**: prefers implementing acts, because they're not subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
  - **OLP**: Parliament and Council must agree on the choice of derived measure, they enjoy wide discretion, and judicial review is limited to manifest errors only.

## 5.9. Enhanced cooperation (143)

- **Differences between MS**: after successive enlargements, the number of MS means that some of them will be unwilling to participate in Union projects, even major ones.
- **Derogations**: there are a number of opt-out and opt-in clauses in Treaties.
- **Enhanced cooperation**:
  - Can be used if support for a measure is insufficient to adopt it, but a coalition of States is still willing to adopt it.
  - It can be used in any Union competence, except the Union's exclusive competences.
  - The Council authorizes enhanced cooperation as a last resort measure, and while all MS can vote on its adoption, only the participating MS are can vote on the resulting legal acts.
  - It can't undermine the internal market, or economic, social or territorial cohesion, and other MS can't interfere with acts adopted under enhanced cooperation.

## 5.10. Treaty revision (144)

- **Amendmend procedures**: Treaties can be amended by the ordinary procedure (which comes in two variants), the general simplified procedure, and a series of specific simplified revision procedures.

## 5.10.1. Ordinary revision procedures (144)

- **Scope**: unrestricted, but it likely won't be used if a simpler procedure can be used.
- **Convention stage**:
  - **Proposal**: amendments can be proposed by the Parliament, the Commission, the government of any MS, and they're notified to national parliaments.
  - **Consultation**: the European Council consults the Parliament and Commission, and if amendments concern institutional changes in the monetary area, the ECB, and then decides by simple majority if the procedure should continue.
- **Intergovernmental Conference stage**:
  - **Adoption**: the representatives of the MS' governments adopt the amendments by common accord.
  - **Ratification**: each MS has to ratify the amendment.
  - **European Council**: if after two years at least four-fifths of the MS have ratified the amendments, the European Council can intervene, but the Treaty doesn't specify how.
- **Variant of the procedure**:
  - **Requirements**: the consent of Parliament, a simple majority of the European Council, the limited scope of the amendments.
  - **Differences**: it's possible to skip the Convention stage, and start with the Intergovernmental Conference stage.
  - **Objections**: Parliament can't object to the content of the amendments adopted, but the national parliaments can object in the ratification stage.

## 5.10.2. Simplified revision procedures (145)

## 5.10.2.1. Art. 48(6) TEU procedure

- **Restrictions**: it can't be used to increase the competences conferred on the Union, and it can only be used to amend Part Three of the TFEU.
- **Procedure**:
  - Amendments can be proposed by a MS, the Parliament, or the Commission.
  - The European Council decides unanimously on the contents of the amendments, after consulting Parliament, the Commission, and the ECB (in the case of institutional changes in the monetary area).
  - Amendments still need national ratification before they can come into force.
- **European Stability Mechanism**: was introduced using this procedure.

## 5.10.2.2. General passerelle procedures (145)

- **European Council**: must be acting unanimously.
- **Possibile amendments**:
  - **Council unanimity requirement**: in the Treaties, can be replaced with a qualified majority vote, except for decisions with defence or military implications.
  - **SLP requirement**: can be replaced with the OLP, with a few exceptions in subject matter.
- **Procedure**: the amendment requires the consent of Parliament, and can be vetoed by national parliaments within six months.

## 5.10.2.3. Sector-specific passerelles (146)

- **Passage to OLP**: allows the substitution of a SLP with the OLP, and must be decided by the Council, acting unanimously.
- **Passage to QMV**: allows the replacement of an unanimous vote with a qualified majority vote, and must be decided by the European Council, acting unanimously.

## 5.10.2.4. Miscellaneous revision procedures (146)

## 5.10.2.5. "Lost treasures" initiative (147)

- **Passerelle clauses**: lay dormant for the first decade of its existence, but the Commission President Juncker argued in favor of their use.

## 5.10.3. Accession and withdrawal (147)

- **Accession**:
  - **Eligibility**: it's available to any European State which respects the Union's values, and is committed to promoting them.
  - **Council**: decides unanimously on the application to accede, after informing the national parliaments, consulting the Commission, and obtaining the consent of the European Parliament with a majority of its component members.
  - **Conditions of accession**: they include **any modification of the Treaties**, and are negotiated by the acceding State and the MS (**not the Union**).
- **Withdrawal**:
  - **Source**: art. 50 TEU.
  - **Requirements**: MS must decide to withdraw according to its constitutional requirements, and must notify the European Council.
  - **Arrangements for withdrawal**: start with the notification, and even if an agreement between the Union and the exiting MS isn't reached, the Treaties will cease to apply after a two-years period, unless there is unanimous agreement to extend the period.
  - **Revocation of the notification**: is an unconditional right of the exiting MS.
  - **Brexit**: the referendum to leave started in 2016, and the procedure ended in 2020.
  - **Secession of part of a MS**: is not explicitly regulated by the Treaties, but in 1984 Greenland withdrew from the Communities while still remaining part of Denmark, and in 1962 Algeria left the Communities after it gained independence from France.

## 5.11. Democratic credentials of the EU (148)

<!-- TODO: 148 -->

## 5.11.1. Case law origins (148)

- **Van Gend en Loos**: the Court relied on the fact that citizens participated in the functioning of the Community through the Parliament to justify the autonomy of the Union's legal order and the doctrine of direct effect.
- **Parliament**: the Court relied on the principle of democratic participation to justify the right of that institution to intervene in judicial proceedings, and the priority of Community-level democratic participation over the competing right to exercise a veto of individual MS, in the name of national democracy.
- **Wightman**: the principle of democratic participation was instrumental in determining that art. 50 TEU should be interpreted in such a way to allow MS to unilaterally revoke their intention to leave.

## 5.11.2. Reform of decision-making procedures and principles (148)

- **European Parliament**: its role was increased dramatically over time, including in the field of policy-making, to ensure the democratic character of the Union.
- **Guiding principles**: conferral, subsidiarity and proportionality ensure that policy decisions are taken only at the Union level when appropriate.

## 5.11.3. Treaty provisions and democratic principles (149)

- **Representation of citizens**: in the European Parliament.
- **Representation of States**: in the Council (as democratically-accountable governments) and European Council (as democratically-elected heads of State or Government).
- **European Citizens' Initiative**:
  - Requirements: a million citizens from 7 MS.
  - Invite: to the Commission in order to act, is not binding.
  - Citizen's proposal: can't fall outside the scope of the Commission's powers to adopt a proposal, requires the indication of the legal basis, and a motivation as to why the measure could be adopted under that legal basis.
  - Principle of conferral: must be respected.
  - Principle of proportionality: the initiative doesn't have to demonstrate that it's necessary.
  - Commission: must provide assistance and advice to the organizers, must examine the request with care and impartiality, a rejection must be motivated.
