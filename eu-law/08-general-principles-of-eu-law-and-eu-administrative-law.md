# 8. General principles of EU law and EU administrative law (212)

## 8.1. Introduction (212)

Treaty provisions and legislative acts are only one part of the process of making law take effect into reality, and a decisive factor is its implementation and enforcement through administrative action by the executive branch of powers.

EU Administrative law is the part of public law enabling and constraining administrative conduct, that is, activity designed to implement and enforce EU law.

## 8.2. Organizational levels and the distribution of powers in implementing EU law (213)

Exercise of the administrative function is undertaken by actors both at the EU and MS level, and some central principles of law govern the distribution and hold the actors accountable.

## 8.2.1. Conferral of powers on the Union (213)

Under the principle of conferral under art. 5(1) and 2 TFEU, the Union is barred from emanating legislation and implementing acts where it isn't authorized to do so.

On the other hand, MS shall adopt all measures of national law necessary to implement binding Union acts (art. 291(1) TFEU), which is a result of the **principle of sincere cooperation** (art. 4(3) TFEU).

**Administrative action at the EU level** is spread across the **Commission, the Council, and EU agencies**.

**EU-level bodies** adopt **acts with general content**, but they've been also conferred with the power to take **single-case decisions** (e.g., the Commission in competition law).

In most policy areas, **single-case decisions** are usually taken by **MS bodies** (e.g., customs decisions).

## 8.2.2. Implementation of EU law by the MS (214)

MS have the **right and obligation to implement EU law** through their administrative apparatus, in the absence of EU provisions to the contrary.

The **principle of sincere cooperation** (art. 4(3) TFEU) obliges States to take any appropriate measure to ensure the fulfilment of obligations arising out of **treaties**, or resulting from **acts of the institutions** of the Union.

They can do so using **existing national legislation**, but they can be obliged to adopt **specific implementing legislation and administrative regulations**.

The MS' autonomy in the fields of Union policy is limited:

- If Union law contains **certain procedures, criteria or organizational** requirements, States must act in conformity with them.
- The legality of the **MS' rules and procedures** is measured by their compliance with the **general principles of EU law and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights**,
- The application of national procedures in the implementation of Union law must be exercised in strict compliance with the principles of **equivalence and effectiveness**.

## 8.2.2.1. Equivalence and effectiveness (215)

The principle of effectiveness requires that MS must grant at least equivalent protection for violation of EU law, to that available against the violation of national law.

If there is no equivalent national law, or if its application doesn't lead to the result of enforcing or protecting a right under EU law, then the principle of equivalence will override the principle of effectiveness.

Administrations must set aside national laws which make the exercise of rights conferred by Union law even only temporarily impossible or excessively difficult.

## 8.2.2.2. Decision-making with trans-territorial effect (216)

The implementation of EU law by MS requires the national bodies to take decisions that can have an effect in the entire EU.

E.g., in EU customs law, once a product has cleared customs, it can freely circulate in the Union, and so customs officials in MS act as customs official of the entire Union.

In order to deal with this, there are **networks** dedicated to the exchange of information and coordination of administrative action. E.g., the Schengen Information System is a large database on persons wanted by law enforcement agencies who are to be denied entry to the Schengen zone.

## 8.2.3. Delegation of powers within the Union (217)

The delegation of powers from legislators to executive and administrative bodies is an inevitable aspect of modern legal systems, due to the technical complexity and balancing of complex interests.

Delegation is not only a practical necessity, but a general phenomenon in the implementation of EU policies.

**Agencies**:

- Aren't referred to as possible recipients of delegation in arts. 290 and 291 TFEU, which allow for delegation to the Commission.
- Their decision-making powers aren't mentioned in the Comitology Regulation, which only mentions decision-making by the Commission with the help of comitology committees.
- Some agencies have a legal basis in the Treaties, but most are created by legislative act.
- Their **tasks** can range from the collection of information, to processing applications, to adopting **individually binding decisions**, where they can exercise **broad discretion**, but always **limited by the provisions of the relevant regulation**.

In the **Meroni case**, the Court allowed **sub-delegation of Commission powers to private parties, despite the lack of explicit authorization in the ECSC Treaty**, with the following conditions:

- The Commission can only **sub-delegate powers** which it had been **previously granted**.
- The Commission had to **control** the exercise of the sub-delegated powers.
- The Commission **couldn't delegate powers** to private parties which would allow them to **adopt acts with quasi-legislative content**, because doing so would upset the institutional balance of powers conferred in the ECSC.

Most EU agencies are established by EU legislative measures, and are based on Treaty provisions:

- That permit the adoption of measures for the harmonization or approximation of national law. E.g., art. 114 TFEU, the general legal base for the adoption of internal market measures.
- If no specific legal basis exists, art. 352 TFEU, which gives residual power for the EU to attain one of its objectives.

## 8.3. Criteria for legality (219)

One of the most important questions is the legality of an act or action of an institution, body or agency acting within a policy covered by EU law.

General criteria for the legality of the acts of the EU exists in the form of the **general principles of EU law**, which have a constitutional status:

- They bind Union institutions in the exercise of their legislative and administrative competences.
- They have to be observed by MS when they implement Union law, they derogate from it, and in all the other cases which fall within the scope of EU law.

## 8.3.1. Proportionality (220)

Under the principle of proportionality, the content adn form of Union action can't exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty (art. 5(4) TEU).

The Court had long recognized it as a general principle of EU law, and it is the most widely used principle, because it can be used to review the legality of:

- Acts of EU institutions that limit or regulate the exercise of rights of individuals. E.g., the Commission imposes an anti-trust fine.
- Acts of EU institutions and bodies that limit MS powers. E.g., a directive limiting the maximum working time for workers per week.
- Acts of MS bodies when they implement EU law.
- Acts of MS when they limit or regulate the rights and freedoms guaranteed by EU law.

The Court of Justice has developed a **three-steps test**:

- Under the first level, the measures adopted by EU institutions must not exceed the limits of what is **appropriate and necessary** in order to attain the objectives legitimately pursued by the legislation in question.
- When there is a **choice between several** appropriate measures, recourse must be had to the **least onerous**.
- There must be a reasonable ratio between **disadvantages caused** and **aims pursued**.

<!-- TODO 221 -->

The **degree of judicial review varies**.

If the institutions enjoy wide legislative discretion, the Court will only check for manifest errors of assessment in the different steps of application of the proportionality test, in order to respect the separation of powers.

In areas other than EU legislation, the Court tends to exercise less judicial self-restraint, and will conduct a fuller review of the proportionality of an act:

- If the institutions have no or only limited discretion.
- Acts of MS which limit EU fundamental rights or fundamental freedoms.
- Acts of the institutions which restrict the applicability of a fundamental right, or balance rights and principles (cf. art. 52(1) Charter).

## 8.3.2. Rule of law: transparency, legality, legal certainty, legitimate expectations (222)

The EU is established as a Community based on the "rule of law", but the exact meaning of rule of law in practice is debated.

The general consensus is that it's an "umbrella principle" with a core content, and several sub-principles, many of which can be regarded as having an independent existence.

## 8.3.2.1. Legality (223)

The action of public bodies of the EU must take place **under and within the law**.

First, a **legal basis for public authorities** is required, due to the principle of conferral (art. 5(2) TEU).

Secondly, the institutions **may not act ultra vires** (beyond the limits of the powers conferred to them).

If **discretionary powers** are conferred, the institution or body must **take into account all the relevant factors** for decision-making, and **can't rely on improper motives** that would lead to a misuse of its powers.

## 8.3.2.2. Legal and institutional transparency (223)

Legal and institutional transparency is a precondition for establishing an accountable legal and political system.

The proceedings of all bodies must be transparent, also by publication of "documents relating to the legislative procedures" (art. 15 TFEU).

The legislature has the duty to publish all legislative measures and decisions (art. 297 TFEU).

Access to documents is an individual right (art. 42 Charter), and the details are laid down in Regulation 1049/2001 on public access to documents.

In **Gottfried Heinrich**:

- Austrian officials confiscated a tennis racquet found in the cabin luggage of a passenger, acting on the basis of a EU Regulation.
- However, the annex listing the items hadn't been published on the Official Journal of the EU, so it was impossible for individuals to comply with the regulation.
- The Court held that the Regulation with the missing annex had no binding force, insofar it seeks to impose obligations on individuals, and so it can't be enforced until proper publication.

Transparency can be lacking in the EU due to the complexity of the legal system, that has been developed through successive layers of Treaty amendments, development of institutional practices, and national opt-ins and opt-outs.

Transparency is directly linked with the legal and political accountability of public actors.

## 8.3.2.3. Legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations (225)

The principles of legal certainty and of protection of legitimate expectations are sub-concepts of the rule of law, they enjoy legal protection and can be used to determine the legality of acts adopted on the basis of, or in scope of, EU law.

**Legal certainty** consists of two requirements:

- **Legal rules should be clear and precise**, so that the **situations and relationships** governed by EU law remain **foreseeable**.
- Individuals must be able to determine unequivocally what their **rights and obligations** are, so that they can take steps accordingly.

This results in a series of **consequences**:

- EU institutions can't apply **inconsistent or contradictory rules** to individuals.
- **Double jeopardy** is prohibited.
- Administrative **proceedings** must be conducted within a **reasonable amount of time**.
- Legal certainty is required for **legal charges and limitation periods**.
- The **retroactive effect** of EU law is prohibited, in principle (cf. art. 297(1) TFEU).

**Retroactive effect is exceptionally allowed** if the public interest in the retroactive effect overrides the private interest in maintaining existing legal situations.

The **revocation** of Union institutions distinguishes between lawful and unlawful acts.

**Lawful acts** in principle can't be revoked, since the private interest in their continuous application generally prevails over the public interest.

**Unlawful acts**:

- Have a legal defect, but they have effect and **remain valid until they are annulled**.
- Their retroactive revocation is permissible, as long as the withdrawal happens within a reasonable time span, and the reliance of individuals is taken into account.
- E.g., State aids are subject to authorization by the Commission, and if they're declared unlawful after they've already been advanced, they still have to be returned, because the effectiveness of EU law (prohibition of State aids) prevails over the principle of legal certainty (keeping the aid) (cf. Alcan case).

**Legitimate expectations** have been recognized since the very early case law of the Court, and it is closely linked to the principle of legal certainty, in that it allows individuals a right to rely on the validity of acts of the Union.

The **protection of legitimate expectations** requires three key elements:

- The existence of **justifiable reliance** that can arise from a **valid legislative act**, or any other act that gives **precise assurances**.
- An **affected interest**, which doesn't apply if the beneficiary knew that the situation was illegal, or if the assurance is contrary to Union law.
- **Priority for the protection of expectations** over the interests of the Union.

**Tobacco farmers case**:

- A Council regulation determined the minimum pricing for agriculture markets, and a producers' association paid farmers in advance for the amount of tobacco that they'd deliver.
- In 1988, after the farmers had planted the tobacco, but before the harvest, the maximum amount of tobacco that benefited from the guaranteed minimum price was changed.
- The producers' association requested the farmers to repay part of the advances, and this was challenged as a violation of the principle of legitimate expectations.
- The Court found that the new regulation was published after the tobacco farmers had made their decision on how much to plant, and so while the measures were foreseeable, in practice the farmers couldn't take it into account.
- Therefore, the legitimate expectations of farmers were not respected.

## 8.3.3. Good administration (228)

The notion of **good administration** is a general concept that contains rights, rules and principles guiding administrative procedures.

## 8.3.3.1. General observations on good administration (228)

Good administration and its sub-principles are protected as **general principles of EU law**.

Art. 41 Charter provides a limited notion of good administration, that applies only to EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.

Good administration and its sub-principles are protected as **general principles of EU law**.

The violation of the principles of good administration may lead to the annulment of an act, and the right to damages for violation of procedural principles.

**Art. 41 Charter** is only limited to single-case decision-making, and it's limited to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union.

The **right to good administration as a general principle** (art. 6(3) TEU) is also applicable to general acts, MS action in the scope of EU law, and third parties if they have a qualified involvement in administrative procedures.

## 8.3.3.2. Sub-principles of good administration (230)

Art. 41 Charter contains a list of sub-principles.

The **duty of care** (art. 41(1) Charter):

- Is the obligation of the administration to impartially and carefully establish and review the relevant factual and legal elements, before making a decision or taking other steps.
- Therefore, arbitrary actions, unjustified preferential treatments and conflicts of interests are prohibited.
- Decision should be taken in a **reasonable amount of time**, not too quickly (to avoid a hasty evaluation) nor too slowly (to avoid violating the principle of certainty).

The **right to a fair hearing and access to one's file** (art. 41(2)(a) and 41(2)(b) Charter):

- Individuals must be given a fair hearing before taking measures that can affect them adversely.
- A fair hearing requires that the party involved:
  - Is fully informed about matters that can affect their position in an administrative procedure, especially if sanctions are involved.
  - Is informed of the administration's response to complains or observations.
  - Is informed of the outcome of procedures, and the decisions taken.
  - Is informed of all matters relating to their defence, including the right of appeal.
  - Is informed with an exact and complete statement about the claims and objections raised.
  - Must be given the right to make its views known on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged and on the documents used.
  - Must be given right of access to documents and the file, which can be limited in the case of confidential information by third parties.
- The right to a fair hearing can't be excluded or restricted by any legislative provision, and it can supplement legislation that doesn't provide for its exercise.
- In situations where the proceedings lead to the adoption of an **act of general application**, the right of hearing is not excluded, but it's unclear if it's a subjective right, or just a factor for the review of the act.

The **reasoning of decisions** (art. 41(2)(c) Charter):

- All legal acts in the EU must provide grounds for the action taken (art. 296(2) TFEU).
- The extent of the obligation to state reasons includes an indication of the legal basis of the act, the general situation that led to its adoption, and the general objectives that it intends to achieve (art. 296 TFEU).
- The lack of reasoning of an act is grounds for its annulment.

The right to receive **compensation for damages** (art. 41(3) Charter):

- The right to receive compensation for damages is regulated by art. 340 TFEU.

**Language rights** (art. 41(4) Charter):

- The entitlement to write to the institutions in one of the languages in the Treaties, and to receive an answer in the same language simply repeats the existing right under art. 24(4) TFEU.
- The right of free choice of language is only applicable to communication with the "institutions" of the EU, and so Agencies and other bodies may be subject to specific language regimes.

## 8.3.4. Information-related rights: freedom of information and data protection (233)

Any person enjoys the general right of access to documents under art. 42 Charter and art. 15(3) TFEU.

Transparency of information is necessary for a fair and accountable administration, and for a functioning and participatory democracy, but it hasn't always been considered a fundamental right, or even a matter of priority, under EU law.

The administrative tradition of public non-accessibility and secrecy of many European countries were carried over into the EU, but after the 1995 enlargement, the Swedish and Finnish traditions of right to access to documents is recognized as a principle of Union law, and with provisions of primary law.

Regulation 1049/2001 was issued on the basis of art. 15 TFEU, and is the general legislation on access to documents, the Aarhus Convention (Reg. no. 1367/2006) on environmental rights provides further-reaching rights, and the food safety law (Reg. 2019/1381) establishes the duty to proactively publish documents.

The exceptions listed in art. 4(2) of Reg. 1049/2001 have been interpreted by the Court extensively, and important parts of the administrative activities of the Commission enjoy a general presumption of confidentiality, and the exercise of access rights requires proof that the individual interest of access outweighs the public interest in secrecy.

Art. 8 Charter provides for the protection of personal information data from misuse by governments and non-governmental actors, but art. 8(2) of the ECHR explicitly recognizes limitations on privacy rights, to the extent needed in a democratic society.

Legal persons are protected with respect to their professional or business secrets. E.g., art. 339 TFEU and other secondary legislation. 

## 8.3.5. The right to an effective judicial remedy and additional rights of defence (235)

Persons affected by measures of the Union or MS acting under Union law must be able to object or challenge actions that affect their interests.

## 8.3.5.1. Right to an effective remedy (235)

The **ubi ius ibi remedium** principle requires that every right granted by Union law must also have a remedy to ensure its enforcement.

The **right to obtain an effective remedy in a court of law** is a fundamental general principle of EU law, and is contained in art. 47 Charter and arts. 6 and 13 ECHR.

The **effective remedy**, according to the Factortame formula, requires that MS:

- May not render impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law.
- Are obliged to guarantee real and effective judicial protection.
- Are barred from applying any rule or procedure that might prevent, even temporarily, the Union rules from having full force and effect.

In the Factortame case, the English High Court was obligated to offer interim relief measures to protect the plaintiff's interests under EU law, even though those measures were not available under English law at the time.

**Compliance** with the effective remedy principle is both in the **procedural aspect** (the rules allow access to a court) and the **substantive aspect** (the remedy is capable of addressing the violation of EU law).

The **courts of law** must be independent:

- The exercise of judicial functions must not be subject to hierarchical constraints, or be affected by the instructions from other bodies.
- The court must be permanently established by law.
- Its jurisdiction must be compulsory (which excludes arbitrarion bodies).
- The procedural rules must be defined by law, and provide an inter partes procedure where the court is an impartial third party.
- The composition of the court and related procedures can't be used as a system of political control.

## 8.3.5.2. Additional rights of defence (237)

**Under EU law, the right of defence** must be ensured not only in judicial procedures, but also **administrative procedures** conducted by EU institutions or bodies, or by MS bodies implementing EU law.

The rights of defence must be enforced even when there is no specific legislation, or if the existing legislation doesn't take account of that principle.

Art. 41(2) Charter contains some of the rights of defence in administrative proceedings, but generally speaking, defence rights include:

- A limited right of legal professional privilege, which includes the right of confidentiality of communications with an external lawyer.
- A limited right against self-incrimination, where requests for information can't require an admission of the existence of the infringement.

In the **Kadi I case**:

- The UN Security Council was authorized to adopt lists of persons and entities who were accused of being associated with terrorist organizations.
- The EU implemented the UN SC decisions with various legal acts, and Yusuf and Kadi, who were Swedish citizens, found their bank accounts frozen.'
- The central legal questions in these cases were the jurisdiction of the EU Courts, and the degree of review of EU legal acts implementing the UN SC decisions.
- On first instance, the Court held that the contested EU legal act could only be reviewed against compliance with international law.
- On appeal, the Court held that the right of defence, of being heard, and to effective judicial review were patently not respected when the EU implemented the UN SC decision as-is, without evaluating its compliance with fundamental rights, and annulled the regulation freezing Kadi's assets.
- The effectiveness of judicial review was violated because Kadi didn't have a chance to make his point of view known, and so his right to defence had been infringed.

In the **Kadi II case**:

- The UN SC tried to remedy the situation, by transferring a summary narrative of reasons for Kadi's inclusion on the list to him, and published it on their website.
- Kadi sent his statements to the Commission, requested the production of evidence to back up the claims and assertions made against him, and that he be allowed to comment on the evidence.
- The Commission ignored the demands, and adopted a new regulation that froze his assets.
- The Court found that there was a breach of Kadi's right of defence, because it had been respected only in a formal and superficial sense, as the Commission considered itself bound only to the UN SC's findings, and didn't take Kadi's requests into account.
- On appeal, the Court confirmed the annulment, and stated that while limitations of the right to defence were possible, they must respect the essence of the right, be proportionate, and take into account the specific circumstances of the individual case.
- The Court concluded that the right of defence and effective judicial protection require that the reasons for a sanction should be disclosed to the person, that the person should be enabled to make their observations known, and that the observations must be examined carefully and impartially, to determine whether the reasons for the sanction are founded.

## 8.4. Conclusion (241)

The entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU under the Treaty of Lisbon (art. 6(1) TFEU) results in a restatement into positive law of many rights and principles that were initially developed in case law.

The case law approach is still valid, and is protected as general principles of EU law (art. 6(3) TFEU).

There is no hierarchy between rights and principles in the Charter and those developed in case law, and this contributes to the dynamism of the EU legal system.

The creation of a general administrative procedure act for the EU would result in a clarification of the rights of individuals and obligations of administrations implementing EU law, and would increase the transparency of the system, consistently with the principles of rule of law and good administration,
