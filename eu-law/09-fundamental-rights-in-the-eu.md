# 9. Fundamental rights in the European Union (243)

## 1. Introduction (243)

- Original treaties: didn't contain any specific reference to fundamental rights.
- Court of Justice: had to develop its own fundamental rights jurisprudence.
- Lisbon Treaty: made the Charter of Fundamental Rights (a catalogue of fundamental rights of the EU) legally binding, and provided competence for the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.
- Competing interests: protection of individuals, and not interfering with national law.
- Rule of law crisis: the EU is unable to enforce its values against MS, but any threats to democracy, fundamental values or the rule of law in one State threaten the EU as an institution.

## 2. Historical background and the development of case law (244)

- After WWII: drive towards international cooperation and codification and protection of fundamental rights.
- European Convention on Human Rights:
  - Catalogue of civil and political fundamental rights.
  - Supervisory mechanism (the European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights).
- Founding European Treaties:
  - Fundamental rights were absent.
  - The original plan for European cooperation was much more ambitious, but due to resistances from States, some parts had to be given up, which also affected human rights.

### Development of the case law of the Court of Justice (245)

- National courts:
  - Afraid that MS could exploit the fundamental rights gap, and use the Communities to circumvent the post-war constitutional efforts.
  - Enforcement of domestic fundamental rights against EU Institutions would violate the principle of supremacy of EU law, and lead to unequal application of EU law from MS to MS.
- Stauder case:
  - Commission decision: allowed distribution of butter at reduced prices after the identification of the recipient.
  - Stauder: argued that the identification violated his right to dignity in the German Constitution.
  - Court of Justice: found that identification by name was not required, and that it was compatible with the **general principles** of Community law in force.
- Outcomes of Stauder case:
   - Fundamental rights: unwritten principles applicable to the acts of Community institutions.
   - Court of Justice: will protect fundamental rights, and declare acts that violate them void.
   - Multiple possible interpretations: the one that doesn't infringe fundamental rights must be adopted.
- Fundamental rights as general principles:
  - Sources: constitutional traditions common to MS, international Treaties (ECHR is the most significant).
  - National courts: considered the standard of protection afforded by the Court equivalent (but not identical) to theirs.
  - Court of Justice: has the sole jurisdiction to declare an act of the EU invalid.

### Scope of the application of fundamental general rights as principles (247)

#### Fundamental rights as a limit to the acts of Union institutions (247)

- Limit to Union action: respect for fundamental rights is a precondition for all administrative and legislative acts.

<!-- TODO: Kadi case, 248 -->

#### Fundamental rights as a limit upon the acts of MS (249)

- Limit to MS action: when they're implementing EU law or acting within its scope, because they have to comply with all the EU's constitutional principles, including fundamental rights.
- NS case: implementation of EU law.
  - Dublin II Regulation: the MS of first entry is responsible to examine asylum claims, but MS retain the discretion to examine the claims even if it's not their responsibility pursuant to the regulation.
  - Claimants: argued that being deported from the UK (where they were present) to Greece (port of first entry) would've breached their right not to be subjected to degrading treatments (found in both the Charter and the ECHR), due to the systemic deficiencies in the asylum system in Greece.
- Carpenter case: acting within the scope of EU law.
  - Mrs Carpenter: moved from the Philippines to the UK, got married there, asked for a residence permit as the spouse of a British national.
  - Immigration authorities: rejected her request because her visa had expired, asked her to leave the country and get a new visa in the Philippines.
  - Interference with the right to family life: the issue was whether the interference was legitimate.
  - ECHR case law: immigration policy, if applied proportionately, is a legitimate ground to limit the right to family life.
  - EU law strategy: the Court of Justice could grant a higher level of protection than the ECHR, and it would also have to take into account the right to move granted by the Treaty.
  - Mr Carpenter: provided services to customers in other EU States, which made him a service provider.
  - Solution: since Mrs Carpenter took care of their children, deportation was a disproportionate interference with the Carpenters' family life, which in turn was a disproportionate interference with Mr Carpenter's right to provide services to the EU.
  - EU fundamental rights: provided a higher standard of protection than UK immigration law and the Human Rights Act (which ratified the UK's accession to the ECHR) would've provided.

## 3. Response of the political institutions: from the 1977 Declaration to the Lisbon Treaty (252)

- Since 1977: the Institutions declared themselves to be bound by fundamental rights, and with every Treaty revision, as the competences of the EU expanded, the protection of fundamental rights became of fundamental importance.
- **Charter of Fundamental Rights**:
  - It was the result of the codification of the Court's case law, and the ongoing attention to human rights.
  - At first it was merely "proclaimed", but the Lisbon Treaty gave it the same legal value as the Treaties themselves.
- **ECHR**: art. 6(2) TEU provides the competence and obligation for accession.
- **Case law**: art. 6(3) TEU provides that fundamental rights from the ECHR and constitutional traditions shall constitute general principles of Union law, and the Court of justice is allowed to go beyond the rights in the Charter.

### Article 7 TEU and the rule of law crisis (253)

- **Lack of general fundamental rights competence**: the Commission can't bring infringement proceedings against a MS that is violating fundamental rights, unless a connection with EU law can be established.
- **Tension with art. 2 TEU**: requires respect of human rights as a precondition to join the EU.
- **Art. 7 TEU**: procedure to react against a "serious and persistent breach" of the values in art. 2 TEU.
- **Haider's election in Austria**: was the leader of a far-right party, showed that art. 7 TEU could only be used after the breach had already occurred.
- **Nice Treaty**: reformed art. 7 TEU to act in the case of a "clear risk" of breach of art. 2 TEU.
- **Current version of art. 7 TEU**:
  - **Clear risk**: the Council can issue recommendations to the MS in question, and monitor the situation, the procedure must be initiated by the Parliament or Commission, and the Council must move with a four-fifths majority.
  - **Serious and persistent breach**: must be decided by the European Council unanimously, and the Council can then adopt sanctions, taking into account the consequences on the rights of natural and legal persons.
- **Political nature**: renders it ineffective, since the majority required for art. 7(1) TEU and the European Council unanimity requirement for sanctions mean that it's almost impossible to obtain the support required.

#### Addressing the rule of law crisis: the case law and the proposals (255)

- **Commission v Poland case**:
  - **Poland and Hungary**: tried to limit judicial independence through broad reforms.
  - **Art. 19 TEU**: requires MS to provide remedies that are sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by EU law.
  - **Commission**: argued that reducing the independence of the judiciary affected legal protection in fields covered by EU law.
  - **Implications**: reforms that attack judicial independence can be attacked, and sanctioned with fines by the Court for non-compliance, the freedom of MS in determining their judicial system has to respect the fundamental values of the EU even though it doesn't have a general fundamental rights competence.
- **Rule of law framework**:
  - **Promotion**: by building a "rule of law" culture.
  - **Prevention**: by requiring annual "rule of law" reports.
  - **Response**: by instituting a strategic approach to infringement proceedings and limiting the access to funds in the case of generalized deficiencies as regards the rule of law.

## 4. Charter of Fundamental Rights (256)

- **Significance of adopting the charter**:
  - **Procedure**: involved not only representatives of national governments, but of national parliaments and the European Parliament.
  - **Adoption in itself**: even though the EU doesn't have a general fundamental rights competence, its adoption is significant.

### Drafting of the Charter (257)

- **1999 Cologne conclusions**: the fundamental rights in the EU should be consolidated in a Charter and made more evident.
- **Content of the charter**: rights and procedural guarantees in the ECHR, common constitutional traditions (as general principles), rights pertaining to Union citizens, social rights in the European Social Charter, and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
- **Inclusion of the EU and national parliaments in drafting**:
  - **Innovation**: normally international treaties are drafted and negotiated by representatives of national governments, and presented to national parliaments for ratification only, without amendments.
  - **Number of representatives**: 16 representatives of the European Parliament to counterbalance the representatives from the Commission and European Commission, and 30 representatives (two for each MS, so that bicameral systems could have two votes).
  - **Democratic legitimation**: the dominance of the parliamentarians, the fact that documents were made public and placed on the internet, the Convention accepted representatives from acceding States and NGOs.
- **Constitution of Europe**: followed the same method, but it failed, and the States reverted to intergovernmentalism (negotiation between MS' governments only).
- **Legal value**:
  - **Doubts**: it hadn't been given an official legal status, but since it codified existing rights, so an exact definition wasn't too urgent.
  - **Lisbon Treaty**: gave it the same legal value as the Treaties.

### Structure of the Charter (258)

- **Departure from traditional structure**: the division between political-economic rights and social rights was replaced, and all fundamental rights are placed (at least theoretically) on the same level.
- **Structure**:
  - **Preamble**.
  - **Six titles**: corresponding to fundamental values.
  - **Horizontal provisions**: general provisions that determine the scope, limits of and derogation from the Charter, the relationship with the ECHR, national constitutions, and international human rights treaties.
  - **Explanations**: they clarify the scope and origin of each provision, which is important, since ECHR-derived rights must give at least the same protection as the Convention, while Treaty-derived rights must give at least the same scope as their Treaty counterparts.

### Substantive provisions of the Charter (259)

#### Title I: Dignity (259)

- **Dignity**: rights which are essential to the enjoyment of any other right.
- **Rights**:
  - Right to human dignity, to life, integrity of the person (which includes the principle of informed consent for medical intervention, and the prohibition of eugenic practices).
  - The prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatments (which was used in the NS case to avoid deporting asylum-seekers to Greece).

#### Title II: Freedom (259)

- **Freedom**: traditional civil and political rights, some new generation rights, and socio-economic rights.

#### Title III: Equality (260)

- **Equality**:
  - Traditional equality rights
  - The right not to be discriminated against on the basis of nationality within the scope of application of the Treaty.
  - The rights of vulnerable members of society (children, elderly, disabled).
- **Right not to be discriminated against**: can have horizontal direct effect.

#### Title IV: Solidarity (260)

- **Solidarity**:
  - Traditional social rights and principles.
  - Recognition of social security and assistance.
- **Rights and principles**: some of these rights are entirely dependent on national laws and practices, and others are "principles" (not self-standing rights, but instructions that the Union legislature must respect).

#### Title V: Citizens' rights (260)

- **Union citizens' rights**: it reproduces rights found in the TFEU, which mainly benefit Union citizens.
- **Administrative rights**: are also available to non-EU citizens resident, or companies who have their registered offices in the EU.

#### Title VI: Justice (260)

- **Administration of Justice**: mainly draws from the ECHR and the common constitutional traditions of MS.

### Horizontal provisions (261)

- **Horizontal provisions**: determine the scope of application of the Charter, the scope and interpretation of rights and principles, the level of protection, and the prohibition of abuse of rights.
- **Concerns of MS**: the Charter can lead to further intrusion in national sovereignty, it could give the Court general fundamental rights jurisdiction, or it's a step towards a federalized EU.

#### Scope of application of the Charter (261)

- **EU institutions**:
  - Are always bound by the Charter, even when not acting within the scope of EU law.
  - E.g., the European Stability Mechanism was adopted outside the EU framework, but the Commission is still bound by the Charter.
  - Court: will try to interpret acts so as to comply with the Charter, but if it isn't possible it will annul the act.
  - E.g., in *Digital Rights Ireland*, it annulled the data retention directive, since it required service providers to retain all data for six months, which unreasonably harmed the right to data protection and private life.
- **Member States**:
  - Provisions of the Charter addressed at EU institutions apply to MS only when they implement EU law.
  - The definition of "implementation" includes giving effect to a directive, regulation or decision, limiting one of the rights granted by the Treaty, the exercise of the power "reserved" to MS in secondary legislation, or when the subject matter is only partially related to EU law.
- **Åkerberg Fransson**:
  - Principle of loyal cooperation: States have an obligation to take all legislative and administrative measures to ensure collection of the VAT due on their territory.
  - VAT revenue: part is destined to the EU's own resources, so any reduction in its collection harms the Union's financial interests.
  - VAT tax penalties: they constitute implementation of the Treaties (cf. art. 325 TFEU), and so fall under the scope of application of the Charter.
- **Alemo-Herron**:
  - **Minimum harmonization directive**: set a minimum floor of protection, MS were free to go beyond that protection.
  - **Charter**: can limit the discretion of MS to provide higher protection.
- **McB**:
  - Coordination of national rules: more limited application of the Charter.
  - McB couple: they separated, the mother removed the children from the jurisdiction of the Irish court before it could grant custody.
  - Family law: reserved to MS, and the Regulation only coordinates national rules, and refers to the law of MS to determine when removal of the child has been wrongful.
  - Mr McB's legal strategy: tried to review national law by the means of EU law.
  - Court: the Charter can't be used to assess reserved subject matters.
- **Cases in which the Charter doesn't apply**:
  - Charter: applies only if MS are "implementing" EU law, doesn't apply if they're giving effect to an instrument created outside the institutional framework of the EU.
  - EU law: covers or applies to ever-expanding fields, so applying the Charter to any subject matter that has been the focus of EU rules would expand its application considerably.
  - Siragusa case: the national court asked whether the national rules were compatible with the Charter, since they sought to protect the landscape, a field where the EU has legislated extensively.
  - Court: "implementation" requires more than the matters being related or having a direct effect on each other.

#### Horizontal application of the Charter (266)

- **Horizontal application**: the Charter doesn't specify whether it applies to individuals.
- **General principles of EU law**:
  - Directives: don't impose duties, can't be used for horizontal effect.
  - Treaty provisions: even if they are addressed at States, they can have horizontal effect. E.g., the provisions on fundamental rights of the EU, such as the prohibition of unequal pay for equal work by men and women.
- Treaty provisions with direct effect and Regulations: Charter is always applicable.
- Directives:
  - Aren't capable of having direct effect, but if the directive details rights also contained in the Charter, then the principle can apply, even if the directive can't.
  - This can be seen as an undeclared horizontal application of directives, or a true horizontal application of the Charter.

#### Scope and interpretation of the Charter (267)

- **Limitation of fundamental rights**: very few fundamental rights are absolute, most can be limited to ensure that public policy objectives are carried out.
- **ECHR**: each article also contains the possible limitations, and there's a general limitation clause for emergencies.
- **Charter**: only features a single general limitation clause.
- **limitations on rights provided by the Charter (art. 52(1) Charter)**: 
  - They must be provided by law.
  - They must respect the essence of those rights and the principle of proportionality.
  - They must be necessary to meet the objectives of general interest recognized by the Union, or to protect the rights and freedom of others.
- **Consistency clauses (art. 52(2--4) Charter)**:
  - **Treaty-derived rights**: must be exercised according to the conditions and limits defined in the Treaties.
  - **ECHR-derived rights**: must provide the same level of protection in the Convention, but the Union can afford more generous protection.
  - **Common constitutional tradtiions-derived rights**: must be interpreted in harmony with those traditions.
- **Minimum level of protection (art. 53 Charter)**: the level of protection afforded by the Charter can't fall below the level afforded by international law, international agreements to which the EU and MS are parties (including the ECHR), and MS' constitutions.
- **Melloni case**:
  - Mr Melloni: had been convicted in absentia, which violated his right to a fair trial according to Italian procedural law, and challenged the European Arrest Warrant.
  - National court: asked the Court of Justice whether surrender could be made conditional upon further review of the conviction in absentia, providing a higher standard than that of the Charter.
  - Court: national courts can't impose their own constitutional standards, otherwise they would be compromising the uniform application of EU law, in cases where EU law leaves no discretion to MS.
- **Difference between rights and principles (art. 52(5) Charter)**: principles can only be recognized in the interpretation of legislative and executive acts, and do not grant free-standing rights.
- **Interpretation guidelines (art. 52(6--7) Charter)**: national law and the explanations in the Charter must be taken into account.
- **Prohibition on buase of rights (art. 54 Charter)**: Charter rights can't be used in order to deprive individuals of Charter rights conferred to them.

## 5. EU and ECHR (270)

- **Lisbon Treaty**: introduced art. 6(2) TEU, which provides for the accession to the ECHR.
- **Negotiations**: they lasted from 2010 to 2013, but in 2014 the Court of Justice found the proposed agreement incompatible with the Treaties, and the process was halted until 2019, when the Council restarted the negotiations.

### Background to accession (271)

- **ECHR**: charter of rights adopted after WWII, the contracting parties created an international court to interpret the ECHR and hold the contracting parties responsible, but it remains a "safety net" providing only a minimum standard of protection.
- **Court of Justice**: stated it would take inspiration from the ECHR in human rights cases.
- **EU not being a party to the ECHR**: raises a serious of legal and political issues.
  - Excludes the jurisdiction of the ECtHR over the EU.
  - Respect for human rights is a precondition for joining the EU, but the EU doesn't subject itself to scrutiny of fundamental rights compliance.
  - Leads to accusations of double standards with third countries, since the EU often imposes human rights conditionality clauses in international treaties.

#### Case law of the ECtHR: the doctrine of equivalent protection (272)

- **Two situations**:
  - MS have discretion: the ECHR is applied to what the MS has done.
  - Challenged act is imposed by EU law: the MS has no discretion, so the EU is violating the ECHR, but it's not a party to the convention.
- **M & Co case**: non-interventionist stance.
  - German authorities: were enforcing a Commission decision within the field of competition law.
  - Defendant: argued that the ECtHR had jurisdiction and than the ECHR was applicable, because German authorities still had to respect the ECHR even while giving effect to EU decisions.
  - Art. 1 ECHR: MS are responsible for any violation of the Convention, even if it's a consequence of the application of international law.
  - EU system: already controlled compliance with international law, requiring MS to control whether the Convention is respected in each case would be contrary to the idea of transferring powers to an international organization.
- **Matthews case**:
  - Matthews: was a resident of Gibraltar, residents weren't allowed to vote in European Parliament elections even though most of EU law applies to that territory.
  - Significance: the inability to vote violated art. 3 Protocol 1 of the Convention, which guarantees the right to free elections.
  - Elections to the European Parliament: were regulated by an Act created by the Community, with the same value as the Treaties.
  - Issues: the ECtHR didn't have jurisdiction because the EC wasn't a contracting party, the UK wasn't able to amend it unilaterally, and the Court of Justice couldn't assess the compliance with fundamental rights in the case of EC primary legislation.
  - ECtHR: found all the EC MS responsible for violations of the Convention, to avoid creating gaps in fundamental rights protection when the Court of Justice can't intervene.
- **Bosphorus case**:
  - **Presumption of equivalent protection**: is established for EU law with regards to the ECHR.
  - **ECtHR**: can review an act even if the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, if the protection of Convention rights was "manifestly deficient".
- **Michaud v France case**:
  - Presumption of equivalent protection: requires the control mechanism of EU law to have been used, which isn't the case if a national court refuses to make a reference on the compatibility of EU law with fundamental rights.
- **Avotiņš case**:
  - **ECtHR**: had to decide the extent to which it had jurisdiction in cases where mutual recognition between MS may come at the expense of fundamental rights.
  - **Equivalent protection**: due to it, ECtHR will intervene only if the protection has been manifestly deficient, but the presumption of equivalent protection must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
  - **Factors for equivalence**: whether the Charter is applicable, and whether the Court of Justice has jurisdiction (which doesn't need to be exercised).
  - **National courts**: under a ECHR obligation to examine whether applying the doctrine of mutual recognition would render the protection afforded by the Court manifestly deficient.
- **Summary of ECHR jurisdiction over mandatory EU law provisions**:
  - Protection afforded by EU law is not equivalent: the Charter isn't applicable, the Court has no jurisdiction.
  - Protection has been manifestly deficient: in the concrete case.
  - National courts: must ensure that protection is not manifestly deficient.

### EU accession to the ECHR (275)

- **Limitations due to no accession of the EU to the ECHR**:
  - Jurisdiction of the ECtHR: is limited to cases where the claimant can rebut the presumption of equivalent protection
  - EU: isn't responsible or bound to judgements, the MS taken collectively are.
- **Difficulties of accession**:
  - ECHR: is intended for States, not international organizations.
  - Court of Justice: its relationship with the ECtHR would have to be clarified.

#### Co-respondent mechanism (276)

- **Art. 3(2) draft agreement**: if an application is directed against a MS of the EU, the EU can become a co-respondent if the compatibility of the EU law is called into question.
- **Co-respondent**: becomes a full party in the proceedings, is bound by the judgement.
- **MS as co-respondents**: in cases concerning provisions of primary law, MS are collectively responsible for amending primary law.
- **Admissibility of applications**: without regard for the participation of a co-respondent in the proceedings, so that individuals aren't penalized for not having correctly identified the potential responsibility of the EU.
- **Incompatibility with the Treaties**:
  - Issue: when deciding whether it appears that the EU is a co-respondent, the ECtHR could be called to express an opinion on the repartition of competences between the EU and MS, which would violate the Court of Justice's exclusive competence.
  - Solution: grant an unconditional right to become co-respondents to both the MS and the EU.

#### Role of the Court of Justice (277)

- **EU is a co-respondent**: proceedings can be delayed to give the Court of Justice the possibility to assert for itself whether the rule is compatible with the Convention.
- **Preliminary ruling**: national courts decide whether a preliminary ruling is appropriate, the parties have no control over whether it's made and what is asked to the Court of Justice.
- **Benefits of delaying proceedings**:
  - Individuals aren't penalized if the national court didn't request a preliminary ruling
  - The Court of Justice can provide the interpretation of EU law compatible with the Charter, and the matter could be resolved without the ECtHR's intervention.
- **Observations**:
  - National court of last instance: if it refuses to request a preliminary ruling, the Court of Justice can rule on the matter, despite the absence of a preliminary reference.
  - Court of Justice has already ruled: it's open to debate whether the ECtHR can give the Court another possibility.
  - MS is a co-respondent: special delaying procedure is not available, because those cases concern EU primary law, over which the Court has no jurisdiction.
- **ECtHR interpretation of the Court of Justice case law**:
  - Prior involvement of the Court of Justice: only when it didn't have the chance to rule on provisions of EU law.
  - ECtHR: would be forced to give a binding interpretation of the EU Court's case law.
  - Solution: grant the EU an unconditional right to request sufficient time for the prior involvement procedure.

### Opinion 2/13: the special nature of EU law (279)

- **CFSP**:
  - **Art. 57(1) ECHR**: no general reservations can be made by contracting parties
  - **Issue**: the ECHR would have full jurisdiction over the CFSP, while the Court of Justice does only in few cases.
  - **Solution**: attribute the CFSP act to a MS, exclude the possibility for EU institutions to act as co-respondents.
- **Mutual trust principle**:
  - **Mutual trust**: MS must execute or give EU law effect without checking if fundamental rights are fully respected in other MS.
  - **Issue**: a State who must give effect to a mutual recognition obligation in the EU may be held responsible under the ECHR.
  - **Solutions**: the Court of Justice has recognized that the principle can be limited in extreme circumstances, the principle of mutual trust could be recognized explicitly in the accession agreement.
  - **Avotiņš case**: in cases relating to mutual recognition, national courts must ensure that the protection afforded must not be manifestly deficient.

## 6. Conclusion (280)

- Evolution of fundamental rights: linked with deeper EU integration, complex and contested field.
- MS: concerned that fundamental rights jurisprudence could excessively impact national rules and reduce sovereignty.
- Scrutiny on institutions: the rights of individuals against institutions have been strengthened with every revision.
- Biggest threat to fundamental rights: not the EU's actions, but its inability to address the backsliding in democratic standards and rule of law in some of its MS.
