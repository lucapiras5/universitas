# 6. The effects of EU law in the national legal systems (154)

## 6.1. Introduction (154)

Besides the multinational dimension to EU law, there is the national dimension of EU law, concerned with the application of EU law in individual cases and to individual people.

The default rules for national application of EU law are direct effect, indirect effect, and primacy, and while they are the backbone of EU law, without which it would be yet another international organization, they're not found in the Treaties, but have been developed by the case law of the Court of Justice.

## 6.2. EU law in the Member States: institutions, procedures, principles (155)

There can be two extreme and opposite models of collaboration at the international level:

- The States agree to minimum requirements for each of the problems identified, and the implementation and enforcement is entirely left to the States, which aren't under any obligation to honor them.
- The States agree to create an organization that can create binding rules, and supervise their enforcement, representatives of the organization would be posted in each State, to defend the interests and enforce the rules, and decisions by the representatives or a judicial body on the matters that fall in the scope of the organization are final.

EU law is between the traditional model of enforcing international law obligations, and a fully-developed federal model.

On the institutional plane (who enforces EU law), all national institutions become de facto EU institutions when acting within the scope of EU law, the Union hasn't created decentralized agencies, it relies on the existing institutional structures.

On the procedural plane (how EU law is enforced), EU law follows the existing national rules of procedure.

The most significant pre-emption of State autonomy didn't take place at the institutional or procedural plane, but through the principles that define the status of EU law within Member States.

Direct and indirect effect and primacy don't determine which institution or procedure should be followed when implementing EU law, but what happens if EU and national law diverge or collide.

Over time, the EU has moved away from the public international model, and while some principles of national application of EU law, certain procedures and remedies and institutional structures became unified, the EU is still far from a complete federal structure, and so it's called a "sui generis" organization.

Determining when a Member State is acting **within the scope of EU law** is fundamental, because it determines whether EU law applies to the individual case.

Cases can fall under the scope of EU law in two scenarios:

- The subject matter of the case is covered by an EU law act, which is then applied by the national authority.
- The national rules enter into conflict with EU laws, typically primary law, such as the four fundamental freedoms.

## 6.3. Direct effect (157)

Direct effect means that an EU provision becomes the immediate source of law for the national court or administration, and no implementing acts are needed for its application within the national legal order.

## 6.3.1. Van Gend en Loos (157)

The principle of direct effect made its appearance in 1963, in Van Gend en Loos, where a Dutch company imported a chemical from Germany, and disagreed with the amount of duty charged by the Dutch Inland Revenue.

Van Gend en Loos claimed that the duty was increased by changing the tariff classification for the product, which violated art. 12 EEC, and the question was raised whether private parties could directly invoke the provisions of an international agreement (the EEC Treaty) in a national court of a signatory party.

The Court argued that:

- The Treaty is more than an agreement that creates mutual obligations between the contracting states, and imposes obligations on individuals, but it's also intended to give individuals rights, irrespective of what the national constitutions state regarding the domestic status of international law.
- Art. 12 contains a clear and unconditional prohibition, that doesn't require any further implementation in order to produce direct effects, regardless of the original intention of the signatories (as opposed to traditional international law, where the intention of the signatories is relevant for the interpretation).

The court therefore created a **new legal order**, independent of national constitutions and international law. 

## 6.3.2. The conditions and the real test (159)

In Van Gend en Loos, a Treaty provision can produce direct effects if it is:

- Clear.
- Unconditional (doesn't allow any reservations by Member States).
- Not dependent on further implementation.

Subsequent case law expanded the test, so that even Treaty articles which required implementation could be deemed directly effective, and direct effect was expanded to other sources of EU law, but the conditions for direct effect for those sources vary, and so it could be said that there is a number of "direct effects" in EU law.

Today, the provision of a directive can be directly effective if it is:

- Sufficiently clear and precise.
- Unconditional.
- The M.S. failed to implement the directive by the end of the period described therein, or didn't implement it correctly.

The true nature of the test is that as long as there is a clear rule of behavior in a provision (e.g. a clear and unconditional prohibition), then it can be applied directly, even if the provisions contains indeterminate legal notions. E.g.:

- Art. 34 TFEU prohibits "quantitative restrictions" and "measures of equivalent effects", which are indeterminate notions, but the prohibition is clear and unconditional.
- Art. 157(1) TFEU contains the principle of equal pay for male and female workers, and while it requires further implementation, a clear and unconditional prohibition can be extracted from it.

Provisions that don't contain an immediately applicable rules aren't directly effective, such as mere aim-setting norms, or provisions that are subject to considerable discretion in relation to choice and implementation.

## 10.3.3. Direct effect in action (160)

A directly effective provision of EU law may **create a new rule** which did not exist before, or **exclude the application** of an existing but contrary national rule.

The test for direct effect is carried out on individual provisions of EU law, and so even single sections or indents may be directly effective.

Direct effect is only concerned with the objective justiciability of EU provisions, and granting individual and subjective rights is not a requirement of direct effect.

Subjective rights may be the cause for an individual invoking EU law in the first place, and they are required to invoke State liability for breaches of EU law (note 21).

## 10.3.4. First differentiation: types of legal acts (161)

Direct effect was expanded to other sources of EU law, and this introduces various types of direct effect, differentiated by:

- The source of EU law.
- The nature of the parties of the legal relationship to which EU law is directly effective, which is distinguished in:
  - (Ascending) vertical, where the individual goes after the State.
  - Reverse vertical, where the State goes after the individual.
  - Horizontal, where the relationship only involves private individuals.

## 10.3.4.1. Treaty and Charter provisions (162)

The case law of the court confirmed the direct effect of the most important Treaty provisions, such as the free movement rules, competition law, State aid, and equal pay, and Treaty provisions can be invoked in any type of legal relationship (vertical, reverse vertical, and horizontal).

Since 2009, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights became part of primary law, and according to art. 6(1) TEU, it has the same value as the Treaties.

It has direct vertical effect, since limiting the public power is very purpose of fundamental rights catalogues.

The Court has confirmed that some Charter provisions can have horizontal direct effect, but this is questionable:

- Charter provisions tend to be vague, and need further implementation.
- They are addressed to public powers, and not individuals.

Most national legal orders deny the direct horizontal application of their fundamental rights catalogues, and instead prefer conforming interpretation.

## 10.3.4.2. Regulations (163)

Regulations are the optimal candidate for direct effect, since they are binding in their entirety, and "directly applicable" in all M.S.

The Court initially equated "direct effect" with the Regulations' "direct applicability", but later distinguished theme:

- **"Direct applicability"** means that a national implementing act is not required unless expressly requested by the Regulation.
- **"Direct effect"** means that a national authority can apply the provision directly.

The direct effect for regulations is presumed, but it's theoretically possible for a regulation to not contain any directly justiciable rules.

Regulations are directly effective in any type of legal relationships, both vertical and horizontal.

The enforcement of a regulation may naturally include sanctions by M.S. and EU institutions. E.g., in competition law, when individuals violate obligations provided by EU regulations or Treaty articles.

## 10.3.4.3. Decisions (164)

Decisions under art. 288 TFEU can be:

- Addressed, if they state their addressees.
- Non-addressed, otherwise, and they are in practice a legislative act in all but name, because they provide a set of abstract and general rules.

A decision addressed to one or more M.S. may produce direct effects with respect to the individuals within them, as long as the provisions are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional.

The direct effect of decisions is limited to vertical situations, and the Court has refused to consider them as horizontally directly applicable.

## 10.3.5. Second differentiation: types of legal relationships (164)

While Treaty provisions and regulations are completely integrated into the legal order, and have direct effect in any type of legal relationship, for directives and decisions, the type of legal relationship matters.

In Van Duyn, the Court noted that directives can be vertically directly effective, and so individuals can rely on a directive's provisions to vindicate their rights against the M.S., as long as the provision is sufficiently clear, unconditional, and the implementation period for transposing the directive has passed.

The Treaties only state that Directives are not directly applicable, and the argument for their direct application came from the **estoppel argument**, by which a M.S. who failed to implement a directive can't rely on that failure as a defence against an individual who is invoking the directive.

It can be seen as a form of "sanction" against the defaulting M.S., whereby if the M.S. had implemented the directive on time, or correctly, it could've exercised its choice, but in failing to do so, it had forfeited its choice.

The estoppel argument excluded the reverse vertical direct effect of directives, because M.S. have to transpose the directive before they can enforce it against individuals.

In Marshall, the Court excluded the possibility for directives to extend to horizontal relationships, because they are only addressed to States, and can't impose obligations on individuals.

## 10.3.6. No horizontal direct effect of directives: the rule and the exceptions (166)

The Court has created a number of exceptions that allow directives to have horizontal effect.

- It **expanded the notion of "State"** to include any organization or body which is subject to the authority or control of the State, or has special powers beyond those normally applicable in horizontal relations. E.g. hospitals, fully State-owned companies, any private bodies entrusted with the exercise of any form of public authority.
- Even when a **State is acting in a "private capacity"**, such as a normal employer, without using sovereign power or authority, the relationship will still be deemed as vertical and not horizontal. E.g., staff employed by a State-run hospital or school.
- The failure of M.S. to notify technical standards and regulations is allowed to spill over into private relationships, thus affecting individuals who may not even be aware of the failure of the M.S.
- Judicially-created principles of law are applicable in horizontal relationships without any limitation.
- A number of Charter articles can be relied upon directly, even in horizontal relations.
- The Court promoted **consistent interpretation** as a way for directives to reach into horizontal relationships, and consistent interpretation can produce similar results to direct application of the directive.

In practice, judicial principles and Charter rights are more indeterminate than directives, which instead have textual limits, so the horizontal effect is much stronger.

## 10.4. Indirect effect (168)

The principle of indirect effect is also known as **consistent interpretation**, and it's the duty of all national bodies to interpret, as far as possible, national law in conformity with EU law, and it's analogous to the duty of constitutionally consistent interpretation imposed by constitutional courts.

Consistent interpretation accounts for the majority of cases where sources of EU law are taken into account directly.

## 10.4.1. Notion of indirect effect (169)

The principle of indirect effect was first articulated in Von Colson, and it states that **all national law must be interpreted in accordance with all EU law, by all national authorities**.

In contrast to direct effect, there are no sources-based exception to this requirement, but in the case of directives, there is no duty of consistent interpretation before the lapse of the implementation period.

Directives are most frequently invoked for the purpose of consistent interpretation, but Treaty provisions or regulations may be invoked as well, even though they are directly effective, if appropriate under the circumstances of the case.

Even EU acts of a non-binding nature, such as recommendations, may produce indirect effect, and it also covers national laws not adopted for the implementations of a directive or other EU act, but any national law, even if they were adopted prior.

## 10.4.2. Scope of indirect effect (170)

The principle of indirect effect is a **scale** of different intensities:

- The **weak indirect effect** happens when a EU provision is simply used as a confirming argument for a result that could be safely reached on the basis of national legal sources.
- The **medium indirect effect** happens when a EU provision determines the choice between several plausible interpretative options.
- The **strong indirect effect** happens when the national law provision is forcefully interpreted to be compliant with EU law.

In the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) case, the Czech Constitutional Court interpreted a provision that stated that "no citizen may be forced to leave his homeland" to mean that "homeland" also included other EU M.S.

The German and Polish constitutional courts had similar constitutional provisions, and stated that the countries may participate in the EAW system, but they'd have to amend their national legislation.

In the choice between direct effect and strong indirect effect, the latter tends to be less controversial than the former, where a judge explicitly disregards binding national law.

## 10.4.3. Unbounded interpretation (171)

Indirect effect offers a robust alternative to the prohibition of horizontal direct effect and reverse vertical effect.

E.g.:

- If there is a textual basis in national law, a private party can ask for it to be interpreted in conformity with a directive that hasn't been correctly implemented.
- A State can't rely on a non- or wrongly-implemented directive to impose obligations on the individual, but it can interpret indeterminate legal notions in national law according to those directives to achieve the same result.

## 10.4.4. Introducing some limits (172)

In reaction to the boundless potential of indirect effect, the Court formulated three limits to the duty of consistent interpretation.

The first is the use of **interpretative methods recognized by national law**, which is explicitly pointed out because in the past the Court expanded the powers of national authorities in order to effectively enforce EU law.

The second is the **general principles of law**, and in particular legal certainty, legitimate expectations, and non-retroactivity, which can be used in horizontal and reverse vertical relationships, because the parties involved couldn't have expected such an interpretation or effect.

The third is the **prohibition of contra legem interpretation**, so that national authorities can't negate, or use artificial or strained interpretations of national law, only to achieve consistency with EU law.

## 10.5. Primacy (174)

The principle of primacy of EU law means that in the case of conflict, EU law prevails over national law, but in contrast to the principle of direct effect (the provision doesn't need an implementing act, cf. 157), it poses more political rather than legal difficulties.

In the EU, the questions of hierarchy and sovereignty remain unresolved, and both the Union and the M.S. have different views on why and to what extent EU law is allowed to prevail over national law. 

## 10.5.1. The Court's view (174)

In Van Gend en Loos, direct effect enabled the new EU legal order to penetrate into the national legal systems, but the unresolved question was with what legal force, and what happens in the case of conflict between directly effective Treaty provisions and national law.

## 10.5.1.1. Costa (174)

The Costa case was decided a year after Van Gend en Loos, and it concerned Italian legislation that was incompatible with the Treaty, but was adopted after Italy had joined the EEC, and the question was whether national legislation may unilaterally derogate from Treaty obligations.

In Costa, the EU stated **absolute EU law primacy**, and all EU law prevails over all national law, and the basis for this claim was the **special and original nature** of the law stemming from the Treaty.

Primacy and direct effect don't necessarily follow from each other, but **taken together**, they allow for efficient enforcement of EU law in national legal systems, while individually, they're ineffective (having only primacy wouldn't introduce EU provisions into national legal systems, and having only direct effect would leave the rank of EU provisions up to the discretion of individual national constitutions).

On the other hand, the European Court of Human Rights didn't make a similar choice to Van Gend en Loos and Costa, and so the effectiveness of domestic implementation and enforcement of the Convention is left to the constitutional systems of the signing parties, and so it can have the status of a national constitutional act, or it can be between the constitution and national law, or it can be implemented as a simple statute.

## 10.5.1.2. Scope and effect of primacy (176)

The primacy of EU law over national law means the **primacy in application** in the individual case at hand, and it **doesn't affect the validity** of the national law provision, but it only means that it won't be applied in the individual case.

Only the legislator or national court can affect the validity of the national provisions, by amending or repealing it.

The underlying logic is the existence of **two independent sets of norms**, so that both sets influence each other, but neither is supreme, and norms of either sets can only be created or annulled by the institutions of that given set, and different courts in the same legal system can decide differently on the compatibility of the same norm with EU law.

Primacy is **unreserved and absolute, in the hierarchical and temporal dimensions**, it applies to all sources of EU law (including secondary sources) and all national law provisions (including constitutional provisions), and it prevails over subsequent national legislation.

Primacy **empowers all national judges to set aside incompatible national laws**, at their own motion, at any stage of procedure, irrespective of what national law says, and without having to ask the Court before doing so.

The same power applies to **national administrative authorities**, who may disregard national law in order to enforce directly effective provisions of EU law.

## 10.5.2. The national views (178)

There is natural diversity in national responses to the Court's claim for absolute primacy of EU law, but with the exception of distinctively monist systems like the Netherlands or Estonia, the premises are remarkably similar.

National constitutional or supreme courts are likely to see themselves as the guardians of the national constitutional system, and the position of the German Federal Court has been influential on other EU countries.

The arguments against the absolute primacy claim are:

- That the basis for the system of EU law is not its "special and original nature", but the Treaties signed by M.S. as an obligation under **international law**, and the States remain the "**masters of the treaties**", and there is no irreversible "Union of destiny".
- EU law is either **under or beyond the national constitution**, but not above it, and the idea that EU law has primacy over the national constitution may be accepted in individual cases, but not normative or conceptual terms.
- The national constitutional courts have the **power to review** whether a EU act **remained within** the powers transferred to the Union (intra vires) or it **went beyond** (ultra vires), and this residual review is usually reserved for repeated violations of the principle of conferral.

The lack of protection of fundamental rights in the original Treaties, and later, the multitude of mutual assistance and horizontal enforcement systems, and the global fight against terrorism have all fueled the reappearance of effective fundamental rights protection as one of the key reservations against the absolute primacy of EU law.

## 10.6. National procedures for enforcing EU law rights in the Member States (180)

EU law has formulated requirements with respect to procedures and remedies for enforcing EU law in M.S.:

- If the EU has its own procedural rules of legislative or judicial origin, they take precedence over national rules.
- Otherwise, national authorities have to enforce EU law using their general national rules and principles, but they must meet the requirements of equivalence and effectiveness.

In the first case, the **"federal choice" pre-empts local choices**, but there is no European code of administrative, civil or criminal procedure, and the default procedures thus remain national, with an additional EU component.

**EU legislation** can either **unify** (regulate the entire subject matter and exclude the application of national laws in the same area) or **harmonize** (approximate the national procedural rules, without replacing them).

**The Court** can also create EU procedural rules, and the Court has touched on a number of elements of national procedural rules (e.g., access to court, standing, legal aid, time limits, interim reliefs, injunctions, ex officio application of EU laws by national judges, evidence, res iudicata, etc.)

The most notable example is the principle of State liability, that straddles the line between procedural and substantive law.

## 10.6.1. The not-so-autonomous national procedural autonomy (181)

The principle of **national procedural autonomy** means that unless EU law provides otherwise, national procedures will govern the enforcement of EU law.

EU legislative competence is governed by the principle of conferral, meaning that it can only legislate in specific areas attributed to it by the Treaties.

On the other hand, if the question relates to the national enforcement of EU law, and it has been submitted to the Court as a preliminary ruling, then the court can touch on any aspect of national procedure, and its competence is functional and transversal, meaning it's not limited to any field or area of law.

All national procedural rules may be subject to the requirement of **equivalence and effectiveness, provided that EU law is involved**.

## 10.6.2. From equivalence/effectiveness to the principle of effective judicial protection (182)

The current form of national procedures to enforce EU law is based on national procedural provisions, as altered in specific sectors by pieces of EU legislation, or requirements formulated by the Court.

The degree of harmonization can differ from a few accidental provisions to a full-scale unification, and **non-harmonized** questions of national procedure are subject to the requirements of equivalence and effectiveness.

**Equivalence** is a prohibition of discrimination, so that EU law-based claims can;t be treated less favorably than purely national ones.

**Effectiveness** requires that the enforcement of EU law-based claims is not **impossible or excessively difficult**, but "excessive difficulty" can vary based on the claimant (a large company or a small business).

In recent case law, the Court discusses the issues of national remedies more in terms of **effective judicial protection** in the fields covered by Union law (art. 19(1) TFEU).

## 10.6.3. State liability (183)

State liability for breaches of EU law is an example of the more advanced judicial unifications of a type of remedy.

The requirements for liability are:

- A **wrong** (an act or omission that violates EU law), of a **EU provision intended to confer rights to individuals**, and the wrong was **sufficiently serious** (these are the EU-specific requirements).
- The existence of **damages**.
- The **causal link** between the wrong and damages.

M.S. can be liable for violations of EU law committed not only by their **administration**, which was uncontroversial, but by their **legislative and judicial organs** as well.

Liability for breaches of EU law applies to **wrongs committed by the Union**, under the same conditions as the States, and **by individuals** (private persons).

## 10.7. The interplay of different principles (185)

Company law has been extensively harmonized by EU law.

Art. 42 of Directive 77/91/EEC provides that M.S. must provide equal treatment to all shareholders who are in teh same position.

Since the claim falls under EU law, any national procedures will be subject to the requirement of effective judicial protection, so that if the national system had no remedies for the protection of minority shareholders, or if they were excessively onerous, EU law would already be in effect.

Since art. 42 is a categorical and clear prohibition of discrimination between minority and majority shareholders, it would most likely produce direct effects, but at the same time, since it's a horizontal situation, directives can't produce a direct effect.

In order to use indirect effect, a national provision that can be interpreted in conformity with art. 42 would have to be found, but it could be argued that such an interpretation could be unexpected and unforeseeable.

If conforming interpretation fails, then the general prohibition of discrimination in art. 21(1) of the Charter can be invoked judicially.

Furthermore, equal treatment of shareholders could be seen as a general principle of EU law, and since they're not "created", but "discovered", they apply to any type of legal relationships, irrespective of the temporal applicability of mere directives and regulations, but the Court argued that there is no general principle of equal treatment of shareholders in EU law.

Finally, regarding a State liability claim, there was a breach of EU law, and the breach was the cause of the damage, but the question is whether the breach is "sufficiently serious", but given the categorical nature of art. 42, M.S. had little discretion in how to implement the Directive.

## 10.8. Conclusion (188)

The remedial landscape in national cases involving EU law is contextual and depends on national legislation, and the approach of national judges, where they may be willing to conform to EU law, or see their role with more self-restraint.

Its main issue is the lack of predictability, because the decision that the national courts will take is unpredictable.

The Court refused to allow horizontal effect of directives to ensure legal certainty, but at the same time, the amount of alternatives that reach into horizontal relationships have the opposite effect.
