# 12. Free movement of goods (365)

## 1. Introduction (365)

- The aim of the internal market is to enable European manufacturers to sell the same product in all MS, as to achieve the economies of scale found in the US, and creating greater prosperity in the region.
- The Treaty of Rome established the "common market" in 1957, and in the current treaties the term has been replaced by "internal market".
- The Court often finds national measures to be contrary to the TFEU, but MS accept these occasional changes because the benefits outweigh the costs.
- EU provisions that ensure the free movement of goods are:
  - Non-fiscal rules, which prohibit quantitative restrictions on the free movement of goods, and measures with an equivalent effect.
  - Fiscal rules, which prohibit customs duties and discriminatory internal taxation.

## 2. Customs union (367)

### 2.1. Concept of a customs union (367)

- The external dimension of the customs union concerns product coming from third countries, and involves a common customs tariff, and a common commercial policy in trade.
- The internal dimension involves the abolition of internal barriers to trade in goods between MS, which is to be achieved with:
  - The prohibition of customs duties and charges of equivalent effect (CEEs).
  - The prohibition of quantitative restrictions and measures of equivalent effect (MEEs).
  - The prohibition of discriminatory internal taxation.
- The prohibitions are immediately effective, and are supported by a body of EU legislation that harmonized national laws, so that goods can flow more freely between MS.

### 2.2. Goods originating in a MS and goods in free circulation (367)

- The provisions on free movement apply to goods originating in any MS, or goods from third countries that are in free circulation in MS, since the EU is a customs union.
- Products originating in third countries are in free circulation if import formalities have been complied with, and the products have been cleared through customs, whether or not customs duties have been paid.
- Goods from third countries placed in free circulation are definitively assimilated to products originating in MS, and the free movement rules are applicable without distinction.

## 3. Meaning of "goods" (368)

- "Goods" are any products that can be valued in money and are capable of forming the object of commercial transactions.
- Goods also include:
  - Objects which aren't ordinary merchandise, such as works of art.
  - Waste, whether or not it has any intrinsic commercial value.
  - Electricity, even though it's not tangible.
  - Human corpses and body parts.
- Transactions covered by the other fundamental freedoms are not goods:
  - Broadcasting, the operation of a lottery and intangible goods other than electricity are services, not products.
  - Coins and banknotes do not constitute goods, if they're still legal tender somewhere in the world.

## 4. Nationality and residence (369)

- The nationality of the trader and purchaser, or the residence of the legal and natural persons involved are irrelevant.
- The only relevant criteria are the origin of goods, and whether they have been put into free circulation in the EU if they originate in a third country.
- For the other fundamental freedoms, the nationality or residence are crucial factors.

## 5. Customs duties and charges of equivalent effect (369)

- The prohibition of customs duties is set out in art. 30 TFEU.

### 5.1. Customs duties (369)

- The abolition of customs duties between MS was an essential element to the establishment of the internal market, since they're the main obstacle to trade.
- Customs duties are charged on goods for the sole reason that they crossed a frontier between MS.
- There are few cases on customs duties, because of the clear and unambiguous prohibition in the Treaties.
- The Van Gend and Loos case (which established the principle of direct effect) was one of the few cases concerning customs duties.
- It is an essential provision, that constitutes one of the foundations of the EU.

### 5.2. Charges of equivalent effect (369)

- Art. 30 TFEU also prohibits CEEs, otherwise MS could easily circumvent the prohibitions on customs duties.
- The Treaty contains no definition of CEEs, so the concept was defined by the Court.
- In the "Diamonds" case:
  - Belgium had established a social fund for diamond workers, and all imports of rough diamonds were subject to a contribution intended to enable the fund to fulfil its tasks.
  - The amount of the contribution was 0.33% of the value of the imported rough diamonds.
  - The Court ruled against the charge, and provided a definition of CEEs.
  - A CEE is a pecuniary charge (obligation to pay money), imposed on domestic or foreign goods by reason of the fact that they cross a frontier.
  - It's irrelevant that the charge is minimal, because any charge is an obstacle to the free movement of goods.
  - The designation and mode of application are irrelevant.
  - CEEs are not limited to charges imposed to the benefit of the State, they can benefit other entities too, and their purpose and the destination of the revenue are irrelevant.
  - Charges that aren't discriminatory or protective can still be CEEs.
- In the "Istanbul Lojistik" case:
  - The Court found that any charge imposed not on the product as such, but on a necessary activity in connection with it with, may be a CEE.
  - The Hungarian charge imposed on Turkish lorries whose laden weight exceeded 12 tonnes was found a CEE, even if it wasn't imposed on the cargo as such.
- Finally, the Court has consistently held that the prohibition of customs duties and CEEs is a fundamental rule, and any exceptions must be strictly constructed.

### 5.3. Permissible charges (371)

- Art. 30 TFEU doesn't apply in two cases:
  - If the payment is for a service that has been rendered.
  - If it relates to inspections required by EU law.
- These charges are not exemptions to the rule, because they aren't CEEs in the first place.

#### Services rendered (371)

- The service must confer an advantage to the individual importer or exporter, and the charge must be proportionate to the benefit conferred.
- In the "Statistical levies" case:
  - Italy had imposed a small charge on imports and exports of goods, and that it was consideration for providing accurate statistics on imports and exports.
  - The Court rejected this argument because the statistics weren't useful to the individual importer or exporter, but only to the economy as a whole.

#### Inspections required by EU law (371)

- If health inspections are required by EU law, MS can recover the costs.
- In "Commission v Germany", the conditions were stated as follows:
  - The charge must not exceed the actual cost of the inspection.
  - The inspection must be mandatory, and uniform for all products in the EU.
  - The inspection must be mandated by EU law.
  - The inspection promotes the free movement of goods by eliminating obstacles that could arise from unilateral measures of inspection adopted by MS.
- If EU law merely enables MS to carry out inspections, the exception doesn't apply.

### 5.4. Charges imposed at the internal boundaries of Member States (372)

- The factor that triggers the imposition of a customs duty or CEE is crossing a border.
- According to the traditional approach, this only meant a border between MS.
- However, the imposition of a charge on the crossing of an internal border can also be regarded as a CEE.
- The internal market should be an area without internal frontiers, with no distinction between internal or international frontiers.

### 5.5. Remedies (372)

- After breaching the prohibition, the MS must eliminate the CEE, and the persons concerned have a right to repayment.
- Repayments are subject to the conditions and procedures established by national law, which are subject to the conditions of non-discrimination and effectiveness.
- Repayments may be excluded if the unlawful charges have been incorporated into the price of goods and passed onto the customers.

## 6. Quantitative restrictions and measures of equivalent effect (372)

- Art. 35 TFEU lays down a corresponding prohibition to art. 34 TFEU, on QRs and MEEs on exports.
- These provisions are intended to eliminate non-fiscal barriers to trade between MS.
- Art. 36 introduces an exception, that provides that QRs and MEEs falling under arts. 34 and 35 may be justified in certain circumstances as being for the public good.

### 6.1. Quantitative restrictions: imports and exports (373)

- The TFEU doesn't define the concept of QRs.
- The Court has held that:
  - The prohibition of QRs covers measures which amount to a total or partial restraint of import, exports, or goods in transit.
  - A "total restraint" is the total prohibition of imports and exports, a "partial restraint" is a system of import or export quotas.
- The concept of QR is the same, whether it concerns imports or exports.
- The definition of MEEs on import is different from that of MEEs on exports.

### 6.2. Measures of equivalent effect: imports (373)

#### Definition (373)

- The main question is to what extent, if at all, measures have to discriminate against imports, for this provision to be engaged.
- Art. 34 uses the word "restriction", but doesn't mention "discrimination".

##### Dassonville (373)

- The classic definition of MEEs includes all trading rules which are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-community trade.
- This definition has been repeated in almost every subsequent case, and the word "trading" is usually omitted.
- In the "Foie gras" case:
  - The Commission claimed that France had breached art. 34 TFEU by creating rules that define the standards for goods sold under the description "foie gras".
  - France argued that the infringement was hypothetical, since the product was produced only in small quantities in other MS, and those products generally complied with French standards.
  - The Court dismissed the argument, since art. 34 TFEU applies to the potential effects of legislation as well.
- In the "Buy Irish" case:
  - The defendant claimed that the advertising campaign encouraging the public to buy domestic goods instead of imports was not a MEE, since imports had increased.
  - The Court replied that relying on statistical data to determine the legality of a measure would lead to inconsistent results.
- In some cases, the Court has argued that measures fall outside the scope of application of art. 34 because the possibility of affecting imports is too uncertain and indirect. E.g, in the "Krantz" case:
  - A German company had sold a machine on instalment terms to a company established in the Netherlands.
  - Before all the instalments had been paid, the Dutch company went bankrupt, and according to Dutch bankruptcy law, the seller's reservation of property before the payment of the final instalment couldn't be invoked against the tax authorities of the Netherlands.
  - The plaintiff argued that this violated art. 34, since it operated as a disincentive to sell goods by instalment to the Netherlands.
  - The Court replied that the effects of such a rule were too uncertain and indirect to warrant the conclusion that it was liable to hinder trade.
- The Court has refused to apply a de minimis rule:
  - E.g., in "Bluhme" a ban on keeping a certain species of bee applicable to an island that amounted to less than 1% of the Danish territory was held to fall under art. 34 TFEU.
- The breadth of the concept of MEEs means that it covers all barriers to imports which aren't already specifically covered by other Treaty provisions.
- MEEs only refer to the "effect" of a measure, not its "purpose".

##### Cassis de Dijon (376)

- Early cases concerned "distinctly applicable" measures (which discriminate against imports directly).
- The Court encountered the first indistinctly applicable measure in Cassis de Dijon:
  - The plaintiffs wanted to import the French drink, but a German provision required all spirits to have a minimum alcohol content of 25%.
  - Cassis de Dijon had a content between 15% and 20%.
  - The Court ruled that this measure constituted a MEE, because producers in other MS had to adapt their product specifically for the German market.
- In "Torfaen v B & Q":
  - A court in Wales issued a reference, concerning the legality of the ban on Sunday trading.
  - The restrictions did not involve any kind of discrimination, nor they were aimed at imports, but the Court still found that art. 34 TFEU was engaged.
  - Even though MEEs are constructed broadly, many commentators thought the Court had gone too far in Torfaen.

##### Keck (377)

- In Keck, the Court reversed the Sunday trading cases and created a new test.
- Measures were divided in two types:
  - Measures that are "product-bound", also called "product requirements", which concern the inherent characteristics of a product.
  - Measures related to "certain selling arrangements".
- The Court stated that measures related to certain selling arrangements could be considered as MEEs only if they discriminated against imports in law or in fact.
- Examples of "selling arrangements" include restrictions on when, where or by whom goods may be sold, advertising restrictions, and price restrictions.
- If there's a doubt on whether a measure is a product requirement or a selling arrangement, the Court inclines towards the former.
- The rationale behind Keck is that in the absence of discrimination, selling arrangements are less restrictive of free trade, since they don't require other MS to produce goods to a certain specification.
- Keck was criticized because it created an artificial and tenuous distinction, and the Court gradually changed the original distinction into one between "selling arrangements" (which are required to be discriminatory) and "all other measures".
- Measures that can't be categorized as product-bound or selling arrangements were found to be MEEs, whether they were discriminatory or not.

##### Trailers (378)

- The Court added that any other measure that hinders "access to market" also is a MEE.
- The judgement was criticized:
  - "Access to market" is a vague term.
  - It's unclear whether Keck is still good law, but the conclusions reached in cases after "Trailer" aren't different from the conclusions the Court would've reached by applying Keck.

#### Brief comparison with US constitutional law (379)

- The "dormant commerce clause" (art. 1, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution) provides that the Congress can regulate commerce between the States.
- The SCOTUS is strict against discriminatory State measures.
- Non-discriminatory measures are lawful unless the burden imposed on trade is "clearly excessive" in relation to the putative local benefit.

#### Some examples of MEEs (379)

- MEEs include:
  - Import licences, even if granted automatically.
  - Inspections and controls.
  - The obligation to produce a certificate.
  - Prohibition on the sale of goods of a certain description.
  - Requirements regarding the presentation or labelling of products.
  - Incitement to purchase domestic products instead of imports.
  - Restrictions on use, possession or storage.
  - Restrictions on health-care coverage.
- Import licences are distinctly applicable to definition, while the other categories are MEEs even if indistinctly applicable.
