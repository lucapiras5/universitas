# 4. Constitutionalism and the European Union (75)

## 1. Introduction: constitutionalism(s) (75)

- **Constitutionalism**: set of ideas that defines what a constitution is or should be.
- **Formal constitutionalism**:
  - **Descriptive**: constitutions are the factual description of the institutions and powers of government.
  - **Normative**: constitutions must prescribe the composition and powers of existing governments.
- **Material constitutionalism**: links constitutionalism to a particular political philosophy.
  - **Democratic constitutionalism**: a government "of the people, by the people, for the people".
  - **Liberal constitutionalism**: government powers must be limited, traditional means include the separation of powers and fundamental rights.

## 2. Formal constitutionalism: contested supremacy (76)

- **Constitutional norms**:
  - Origin: granted by a monarch, adopted by a parliament, result from a treaty between States, etc.
  - Validity: can't be derived from other norms, but is the result of a social convention.
- **Highest norms in the EU legal order**:
  - **EU Treaties**: stand above Union legislation and any other forms of EU law, but did not expressly state the supremacy of EU law over national law.
  - **Decentralized perspective**: supremacy can be determined by the national legal orders.
  - **Centralized perspective**:there is a Union doctrine of supremacy.

### Legal supremacy: two perspectives (78)

- **Court of Justice**: tried to turn the question of supremacy into a principle of EU law.
  - **Costa v ENEL**: EU Treaties must prevail over national law.
  - **Internationale Handelgesellshaft**: EU law must prevail over even the Constitutional norms in MS.
- **Member States**:
  - **Relative supremacy**: is enjoyed by EU law over national law in some fields, as long as it's permitted by national constitutional law.
  - **Validity of EU law**: ultimately derives from the national decision to accede to the EU.
  - **Limits of EU law**: can't violate national fundamental rights, can't act ultra vires, can't have an exclusive competence to delimit its own competences.

### Contested hierarchies: federalism and constitutional pluralism (80)

- **Classic constitutionalism**: existence of a national constitutional law automatically excludes the existence of European constitutional law, there can be only one supreme constitution within a legal order.
- **Federal constitutionalism**:
  - **Unstable balance**: both the Federation and its Member States have "constitutional" claims, and sovereignty is suspended in "real" federations.
  - **Possible outcomes**: either the Union's claims prevail (and becomes a sovereign State), or the MS' do (the Union becomes an international organization).
- **Constitutional pluralism**:
  - Notion: accepts the existence of multiple constitutional orders that aren't hierarchically ordered, but may interact in a heterarchical way.
  - In reality: the lack of a single point where all legal authority can be explained is not a sui generis trait of the EU, but it's part of the federal doctrine.

## 3. Democratic constitutionalism I: popular sovereignty (82)

### Unitary constitutionalism (82)

- **Democratic constitutionalism**: the People are sovereign, and must create the constitution, either directly or through representatives.
- **European constitutional "people"**: have never existed to validate the European constitutional architecture.
- **Unitary constitutionalism**: not a good theoretical fit, since there's multiple people and sovereign powers in the EU.

### Federal constitutionalism (83)

- US Constitution: was ratified by a plurality of "people", each belonging to distinct and independent States, and was an international act.
- "We the People": did not refer to a popular referendum, but to the peoples of the various States.
- C. Schmitt: the normative foundation of a Union of States is a "federal treaty", and the constituent power is pluralist (not limited to a single demos).
- **Democratic validation of federal or pluralist constitutions**:
  - **Most democratic**: constitutional referendums.
  - **Less democratic**: ratification through State conventions (like the US Constitution).
  - **Least democratic**: ratification through ordinary State legislature, which makes the EU Treaties **"legislative"** rather than **"constitutional"**, and contributes to the **democratic deficit** of the Union.

## 4. Democratic constitutionalism II: popular representation (85)

- Democratic governmental systems: must reflect the will of the people.
- Governmental powers: not all of them are democratic. E.g., the judiciary is often not elected.
- Models of democratic government:
  - Parliamentary system: the executive is elected and controlled by the parliament.
  - Presidential system: the executive is independent and has its own democratic legitimation.
- Art. 10 TEU: functioning of the Union must be founded on representative democracy.

### Democratic legitimacy and the Union legislature (85)

- Unitary State: parliamentary democracy requires that all legislative power is placed in a parliament elected on the principle of "one person, one vote".
- Union of States: two democratic constituencies, one for each State and one representing the Union.
- EU:
  - Legislator: Parliament is elected by the Union's citizens, the Council indirectly represents the MS' democratically organized people, but indirect representation doesn't cause a democratic deficit.
  - Distribution of seats: degressive proportionality, distorts the democratic principle of "one person, one vote", but this deviation is justified in that the Union shouldn't be judged with standards intended for States.
  - Legislative powers of Parliament: the OLP satisfies the requirements of democratic constitutionalism, but the SLPs give fewer powers to the Parliament, resulting in a democratic deficit.

### Democratic legitimacy and the Union executive (88)

- EU executive branch: sits between the parliamentary and presidential systems.
- Dual executive:
  - European Council: heads of State or government, with democratic legitimation.
  - Commission: Parliament must elect the President of the Commission, and confirm the Commission as a collective body, which will remain responsible to the Parliament, since the latter can vote on a motion of censure.
- Governmental functions:
  - Executive: enforces legislation, acts under the Union legislature.
  - Law-making powers: traditionally the executive shouldn't have autonomous or delegated law-making power due to its indirect democratic credentials, but the advent of the administrative State has led to their use.
  - Essential political choices: the legislator can't delegate their adoption.
  - Non-essential political choices: the legislator can revoke the delegation or veto the adoption of a specific delegated act.
  - Implementing acts: less democratic system of law-making, but it's intended to protect the MS in the Union's system of executive federalism.

## 5. Liberal constitutionalism I: separation of powers (90)

### Classic separation of powers principle (90)

- **Liberal constitutionalism**: establishes limits to absolute power to protect freedom by dividing the power of government and placing it in different hands.
- **Montesquieu**: defined the three powers (legislative, executive, judiciary power), and stated that they should be distributed to "separate" institutions.
- **Functional separation**: each governmental institution can only be given one governmental function.
- **Institutional cooperation**: each governmental function is distributed over more than one institution, to create a system of checks and balances.
- **Distinct institutions**
  - **Personal independence**: the same persons can't be part of separate institutions.
  - **Political independence**: each power should have a will of its own and the members of each should have as little agency as possible in appointing the member of others.
  - **Parliamentary system**: is a breach of the separation of powers doctrine, the presidential system with separate elections for the executive branch is preferable.

### Separating "powers" in the EU (93)

- **Originally**: the EU had executive and judicial powers, but the "regulatory" competences weren't considered of "legislative" quality.
- **Currently**:
  - EU Treaties: formally acknowledge "legislative" procedures, and the power can be delegated to the executive.
  - Institutional cooperation: each Institution has its own article in the TEU, which also describes how the various government functions are exercised through institutional cooperation.
- **Art. 13(2) TEU**:
  - **Ultra vires doctrine**: each Institution must act within its powers, as defined by the Treaties.
  - **Mutual sincere cooperation**: each Institution must exercise its powers with due regard for the powers of the other institutions.

## 6. Liberal constitutionalism II: fundamental rights (96)

- **Fundamental rights**:
  - **Origin**: liberal constitutionalism recognized the "individual", who had an inviolable private sphere.
  - **Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776)**: expressly recognized natural rights, they could bind the constitution-makers too.
- **Safeguards of liberalism**:
  - **Judicial**: human rights.
  - **Political**: separation of powers.
- **Judicial review in light of fundamental rights**:
  - Scope: includes the actions of the executive and parliamentary legislation.
  - **Constitutional traditions of MS**: the Court used them as the original source of human rights, since originally there was no "bill of rights", but they weren't grounded in natural law.
  - **Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU**: only "reaffirms" existing "constitutional" rights, doesn't mention "natural" rights.

### Fundamental rights as general principles (97)

- **Stork case**:
  - **Mortgage theory**: national fundamental rights would bind the EU, since the MS couldn't create an organization with more powers than themselves.
  - **Court**: rejected the argument, its only task is to apply EU laws without regard for their validity under national law, and so national fundamental rights couldn't be the direct source of human rights.
- **Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case**:
  - Fundamental rights can be found in the general principles of EU law,
  - Respect for fundamental rights forms an integral part of the general principles of law provided by the Court of Justice.
- **Nold case**:
  - Fundamental rights: are an integral part of the general principles of law, the Court can take inspiration from the common constitutional traditions of the MS.
  - International agreements: which the MS have collaborated on, or are parties to, can provide guidelines which should be followed in the framework of EU law.

### EU Charter of fundamental rights (98)

- European Council: initiative for a "Charter of Fundamental Rights", to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in Europe.
- Validity: it was proclaimed in 2000, but wasn't legally binding until the Lisbon Treaty amended art. 6(1) TEU to give the Charter the same legal value as the Treaties.
- Content: codifies existing rights (doesn't create new rights) from various source (not just the Treaties).

## 7. Conclusion (99)

- EU constitutional theory: must be derived from its substantial constitutional choices.
- Constitutionalism:
  - Liberal constitutionalism: most easily satisfied.
  - Formal and democratic constitutionalism: not easily satisfied due to the democratic deficit, and the "unitary" State standard adopted by classical constitutionalism.
  - Federal constitutionalism: can explain why there two constitutional claims can coexist, the pluralist version of popular sovereignty, and the bicameral structure of the Union legislator.
